<h1>Feeling Out of Sync in Your Body, Mind or Relationships?</h1>
<p>Bring more ease to your body, clarity to your mind, and depth to your relationships.</p>
</div>
<h2>What This Website is About</h2>
<p>If you've found your way here, you're probably thoughtful, self-aware and wanting more alignment. Yet something feels out-of-sync. Maybe it's...</p>
<ul>
<li>A sore back</li>
<li>A conflict that won't resolve</li>
<li>A quiet longing for something different.</li>
</ul>
<p>I work with people like you to explore exactly where you are at and to support you in embracing new possibilities in life. We can address tension in your body, difficulties in your relationships, or simply the desire to feel more at ease and alive.</p>
<p>This website is a way to work with me directly, and also a place for you to explore my writing and video content. I am a prolific creator and you should be able to get a flavour of the way that I love to support people by reading and watching my content.</p>
<h2>Two ways to work with me</h2>
<p>Body and mind are connected. They are both gateways to access the truths within you. That's why I offer both <strong>body-work</strong> and <strong>conversational-work</strong>. Both of these methods are doorways that help us collaboratively find your next most empowering steps</p>
<h3>Coaching Conversations</h3>
<p>For people wanting to live and love with more honesty, clarity, and presence.
Our sessions are a place to pause and listen — to what’s actually true underneath the noise.
You might come with questions about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Life direction</li>
<li>Simply how to live in a way that feels more you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feldenkrais</h3>
<p>Through gentle movement and awareness, we retrain your nervous system to move — and live — with more freedom.
Whether you come with tension, imbalance, or just a wish to feel more at ease in your body, this work helps you rediscover a sense of flow and support from within.</p>

<h2>From the Blog</h2>
<p>Insights and reflections to help you live from the inside out.</p>

<h2>An Invitation</h2>
<p>If something here resonates — even if you can’t yet name why —
I invite you to <a href="/contact/">reach out</a>. We can have an introductory conversation together to explore what’s happening for you and see whether working together feels right.</p>
