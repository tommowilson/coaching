        <h1>Coaching Conversations</h1>
<p style="margin-top:0.2rem; font-size:1.25rem; color:#666; font-style:italic;">For people who want to feel more at home in themselves, in their relationships, and in life.</p>
<h2>What this work is about</h2>
<p>Most people who come to me aren’t starting from zero.
They’ve already done some personal work — maybe therapy, self-development, or years of reflection — but still find themselves repeating the same patterns.</p>
<p>They know how they should show up… but something inside doesn’t cooperate.
They get stuck, withdraw, or lose themselves when things really matter.</p>
<p>Coaching with me is about slowing down enough to listen to what’s underneath those patterns — to the intelligence that lives in the body, the emotions, and the space between thoughts.
Together, we bring curiosity, warmth, and awareness to what’s happening, so something new can emerge naturally.</p>
<h2>How it helps</h2>
<p>Over time, people often notice:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 1em;">
	<li>more honesty in how they express themselves</li>
	<li>more ease and understanding in relationships</li>
	<li>more connection to their inner direction</li>
	<li>less pressure to perform or get it “right”</li>
	<li>a quieter sense of trust in life itself</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t about fixing yourself.
It’s about creating conditions where your natural clarity, sensitivity, and strength can return.</p>
<h2>What happens in a session</h2>
<p>Each session is a conversation — but not the usual kind.
We start where you are and follow what’s alive in the moment.
Sometimes we stay with emotion, sometimes with body sensation, sometimes with a story that wants to be seen differently.</p>
<p>There’s no script or method to follow — just a space that invites your own wisdom to show itself.</p>
<p>Sessions are 60 minutes, online or in person.
We can begin with a single session or a short series, depending on what you need.</p>

<h1>Is this for you?</h1>
<p>This work may be right for you if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 1em;">
	<li>You want to move beyond old relational patterns.
</li>
	<li>You’re craving a gentler, more embodied way of growing.</li>
	<li>You’re ready to explore what it means to live from the inside out.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure, we can simply talk.
There’s no expectation — just a chance to meet and see if it feels like a good fit.</p>
<p><a href="#">Book a free conversation →</a></p>
<h1>A note</h1>
<p>I don’t offer formulas or five-step plans.
What I offer is presence, attention, and the kind of listening that helps you remember who you are when you’re not trying to be anyone.</p>
