<p style="margin-top:0.2rem; font-size:1.25rem; color:#666; font-style:italic;">Reconnecting with the quiet intelligence of your body.</p>
<h2>What this work is about</h2>
<p>Most of us learned to move — and to live — by adapting.
We tensed where we needed to protect. We pushed through when we should have paused. We forgot how effortless movement can feel.</p>
<p>The Feldenkrais Method offers a way back.
It’s not exercise, and it’s not about fixing what’s “wrong.”
It’s a process of learning — through awareness — how to move with more freedom, sensitivity, and choice.</p>
<p>As you learn to move differently, you start to live differently.
Your movement, emotions, and thinking are all expressions of the same system.
When one changes, the rest follows.</p>
<h2>How it helps</h2>
<p>People come to Feldenkrais for many reasons — pain, tension, injury, anxiety, or simply curiosity — but what they often find is something deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lighter, more fluid sense of movement</li>
<li>Less pain and strain</li>
<li>A calmer, more settled nervous system</li>
<li>A clearer sense of self in space and in life</li>
<li>Renewed creativity and ease</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about stretching or strengthening.
It’s about rediscovering your body’s natural intelligence — the one that’s been there all along.</p>
<h2>What happens in a session</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to experience Feldenkrais:</p>
<p>Awareness Through Movement — gentle guided explorations done through verbal instruction, usually lying or sitting. You’re invited to notice how you move, sense differences, and discover easier options.</p>
<p>Functional Integration — hands-on, non-invasive sessions where I move you gently to help your system feel new patterns of coordination and ease.</p>
<p>Each session is unique. There’s no right or wrong way — only curiosity, attention, and discovery.</p>
<h2>Is this for you?</h2>
<p>Feldenkrais might be for you if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 1em;">
  <li>You’re dealing with pain or tension that hasn’t shifted with other methods</li>
  <li>You’re interested in moving with more freedom and pleasure</li>
  <li>You’re curious about the connection between movement, emotion, and awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re new to it, you can start with a single session or a small series.
No experience required — just curiosity.</p>

<h2>What Previous Clients Have Said</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>My mood has improved dramatically because I'm nearly pain free after nearly 1 year of chronic pain that no physio, osteopath, chiropractor or acupuncturist could treat.
Overall, it felt you were my life saver. I'm nearly back to normal. You have taught me to be curious about the pain rather than treat it like my enemy (if that makes sense). No other practitioner could help me, listened to me or really cared. I felt you actually cared!</p>
<p><em>— Andrea</em></p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks Tom! I've learnt so much from the Feldenkrais sessions I've had with you. Your sensitive yet clear way of approaching this work creates a safe environment for me to listen deeply to my body and I find that I leave with a profound sense of ease. There's nothing quite like the feeling of being at home in my own body!</p>
<p><em>— Tara</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Limited Opportunity</h2>
<p>Over the last few years I've welcomed 2 new children into my life. As a result, my practice has been quite intermittent.</p>
<p>Now I am moving into a stage of consistency. That's why I am currently offering a limited number of sessions at a reduced price.</p>
<p>I have capacity for offering 3 sessions weekly at the reduced price of $50 / session</p>
