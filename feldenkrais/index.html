<h1>Relearning Ease</h1>
<p>Rediscover how to move, feel, and relate from a place of calm awareness - and a body that feels like home again.</p>
</div>
<h2>What this work is about</h2>
<p>Most of us have lost touch with how to move naturally.
We stop listening to our bodies. We follow instructions, imitate what others do, scroll for fixes online—trying to get it “right.”</p>
<p>Over time, this leaves us stiff, disconnected, and unsure of what authentic movement even feels like. Our bodies may feel like something we manage, rather than something we <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>The Feldenkrais Method is a path beyond that.
It’s not about fixing what’s “wrong.” It’s about evolving—through awareness—toward movement that is freer, more sensitive, and more alive.</p>
<p>As you move differently, the rest of your life begins to shift.
Your movement, emotions, and thinking are all part of the same system. When one flows, the others naturally follow.</p>
<h2>How it helps</h2>
<p>People come to Feldenkrais for pain, tension, injury, anxiety, or simple curiosity — but most discover something deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lighter, more fluid sense of movement</li>
<li>Less pain and strain</li>
<li>A calmer, more settled nervous system</li>
<li>A clearer sense of self in space and in life</li>
<li>Renewed creativity and ease</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about stretching or strengthening.
It’s about rediscovering your body’s natural intelligence — the one that’s been there all along.</p>
<h2>What happens in a session</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to experience Feldenkrais:</p>
<p><strong>Awareness Through Movement</strong> — gentle guided explorations done through verbal instruction, usually lying or sitting. You’re invited to notice how you move, sense differences, and discover easier options.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Integration</strong> — hands-on, non-invasive sessions where I move you gently to help your system feel new patterns of coordination and ease.</p>
<p>Most people leave feeling lighter, clearer, and more at ease — as if their body remembered something it had quietly known all along.</p>
<h2>Is this for you?</h2>
<p>Feldenkrais might be for you if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 1em;">
  <li>You’re dealing with pain or tension that hasn’t shifted with other methods</li>
  <li>You’re interested in moving with more freedom and pleasure</li>
  <li>You’re curious about the connection between movement, emotion, and awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re new to it, you can start with a single session or a small series.
No experience required — just curiosity.</p>
<p>Pricing is $100 for a 1 hour session in Oratia, West Auckland.</p>
<h2>What Previous Clients Have Said</h2>
<p>Here’s what clients have experienced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mood has improved dramatically because I'm nearly pain free after nearly 1 year of chronic pain that no physio, osteopath, chiropractor or acupuncturist could treat.
Overall, it felt you were my life saver. I'm nearly back to normal. You have taught me to be curious about the pain rather than treat it like my enemy (if that makes sense). No other practitioner could help me, listened to me or really cared. I felt you actually cared!</p>
<p><em>— Andrea</em></p>

<p>Thanks Tom! I've learnt so much from the Feldenkrais sessions I've had with you. Your sensitive yet clear way of approaching this work creates a safe environment for me to listen deeply to my body and I find that I leave with a profound sense of ease. There's nothing quite like the feeling of being at home in my own body!</p>
