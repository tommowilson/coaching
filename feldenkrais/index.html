<h1>Relearning Ease</h1>
<p>When your body hurts, it can feel like parts of your life quietly shrink.</p>
</div>
<p>That walk you used to take without thinking.<br>
Sitting through a workday without counting the hours.<br>
The simple relief of waking up and not scanning for the “problem spot.”</p>
<p>When discomfort becomes constant, it’s easy to wonder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is this just how it’s going to be from now on?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that place.<br>
I’ve lived versions of it myself.<br>
And what I’ve seen over and over — in my own recovery and in hundreds of sessions — is this:</p>
<p><strong>Your body hasn’t failed you.<br>
It’s doing the best it can with the patterns it knows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And patterns can change.</strong></p>
<h2>A glimpse of what this work can do</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A man in his fifties arrived tense, limping, and worn down by years of hard work. By the end of the session, his body had found a new ease — walking felt natural, balanced, and surprisingly light. He left both shocked and delighted, marveling at how different moving could feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the changes are subtle. Sometimes they’re immediate. But they’re almost always surprising — and meaningful.</p>
<h2>What Feldenkrais is Really About (In Simple Human Terms)</h2>
<p>Most of us move in ways we never consciously chose.</p>
<p>Not because we’re careless — but because life shapes us:</p>
<ul>
<li>carrying tension in the jaw after years of holding back emotion</li>
<li>protecting an old injury long after it’s healed</li>
<li>slumping into a posture that once felt safe</li>
<li>rushing through days that never let the body settle</li>
<li>tightening the chest from years of “pushing through”</li>
</ul>
<p>These patterns live in the background, steering our movement, our breath, and even our sense of ourselves.</p>
<p>And slowly, the body stops feeling like a companion — and starts feeling like something we have to manage.</p>
<p>The Feldenkrais Method offers a way back into partnership with yourself.</p>
<p>Not through stretching harder.<br>
Not through bracing or strengthening your way out of pain.<br>
But through helping your system <em>organise itself</em> in ways that feel natural, efficient, and kind.</p>
<p>When your body discovers easier options, everything changes.</p>
<h2>How this feels different from physio or massage</h2>
<p>If other therapies have helped for a little while but never truly shifted how your body moves, this can feel different. Instead of focusing on pain or tight spots, we explore the patterns your body has learned — the subtle habits that shape every movement. That’s why the changes often stick.</p>
<h2>What happens in a session</h2>
<p>A session with me isn’t about forcing anything to change.
It’s about working with how your system is currently organising itself — and inviting it to find possibilities it hasn’t had access to.</p>
<p>We begin with simple movements.<br>
Small explorations: turning, shifting, reaching, rolling.</p>
<p>Inside those movements are layers of information.</p>
<p>You might notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>your spine isn’t participating as much as you thought</li>
<li>your breath pauses during effort</li>
<li>your hips are doing the job your ribs should be doing</li>
<li>your whole system is “helping” more than necessary</li>
<li>a subtle guarding you didn’t realise was there</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we explore gently — slowly enough for something real to change.</p>
<p>My hands offer your system experience, not pressure.<br>
Your attention helps those experiences settle.</p>
<p>People often say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It feels like my body rearranged itself.”</li>
<li>“There’s a softness I haven’t felt in years.”</li>
<li>“I can move without bracing.”</li>
<li>“I feel taller… but not because I tried.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the change is delicate.<br>
Sometimes it’s unmistakable.<br>
But it’s almost always meaningful.</p>
<p>If you want a deeper look at what actually happens inside a session, I’ve written more about it here:</p>
<p><a href="/1-1-bodywork/">What Really Happens in a 1:1 Bodywork Session</a></p>
<h2>What to Expect in Your First Session</h2>
<ul>
<li>You stay fully clothed</li>
<li>Everything is gentle</li>
<li>We go at your pace</li>
<li>No stretching or forcing</li>
<li>Many people feel calmer afterward</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why it works</h2>
<p>Your nervous system learns through experience — not force.</p>
<p>It built your current patterns through repetition, survival, and doing what it believed would keep you going.</p>
<p>And with the right conditions, it can learn new patterns just as naturally.</p>
<p>As your system gets clearer information, the body reorganises:</p>
<ul>
<li>pain softens</li>
<li>movement becomes smoother</li>
<li>strength feels easier</li>
<li>balance feels more dependable</li>
<li>everyday tasks stop triggering tension</li>
<li>you feel more grounded in yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes don’t come from effort.<br>
They come from giving your body options.</p>
<p>Your system is far more adaptable than you’ve been taught to believe.</p>
<h2>Is this for you?</h2>
<p>This work might be right for you if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you’ve tried physio, stretching, or strengthening and nothing has “stuck”</li>
<li>you want more than temporary relief — you want change that lasts</li>
<li>you feel tense or guarded in your movement</li>
<li>you sense that your body and your emotions affect each other</li>
<li>you want to feel more fluid, confident, and at ease</li>
<li>you want your body to feel like home again</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be flexible.<br>
You don’t need to “know your body.”<br>
You just need to be curious.</p>
<p>Pricing: $80 for a one-hour session in Oratia, West Auckland.</p>
<h2>What clients have shared</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“My mood has improved dramatically because I'm nearly pain-free after nearly 1 year of chronic pain…
You taught me to be curious about the pain rather than treat it like my enemy. No other practitioner really listened or cared. I felt you actually cared.”<br>
— Andrea</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your sensitive yet clear way of approaching this work creates a safe environment for me to listen deeply to my body. I leave with a profound sense of ease — there’s nothing quite like the feeling of being at home in my own body.”<br>
— Tara</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>If You'd Like to Try a Session</h2>
<p>If something in you is saying, “I want this,” the best next step is simply to reach out.</p>
<p>Tell me a little about what’s going on, and I’ll reply personally with what I recommend.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure yet, just message me anyway.
Tell me what’s going on. I’ll let you know honestly if I think I can help.</p>
