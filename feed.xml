        <![CDATA[
      <p>One of the biggest struggles I see with couples is that they find themselves in a state where they are &quot;triggered&quot; and then they are no-longer operating from their full-self that can see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Instead, defense-mechanisms come online to run the conversation. The whole paradigm of the relationship changes in that moment. It's no longer team-work, it's you-vs-me. It's war. It's attack and defense.</p>
<p>From this place, they no longer have access to their full set of resources. They are limited to strategies that help them to stay safe. They may shut down, hide, attack or exhibit a range of behaviours that are quite unhelpful to a loving connected relationship.</p>
<p>People say things like &quot;everything is great when things are going well, but once there is some conflict, it escalates into a fight. From there, it doesn't seem like there's much I can do to bring things back&quot;</p>
<p>What I would like to share here is some thoughts about how to navigate this situation differently so that you don't find yourself stuck in way of being that ultimately erodes trust and damages relationships.</p>
<p>Instead you can develop the skills and awareness to navigate conflict in a way that can maintain connection with the other person while still being able to work through the difficulty.</p>
<h2>Relationship Agreement</h2>
<p>Lets start really big picture. It is really important to have conversations about your relationship when you're in a relationship.</p>
<p>One of those important conversations is about HOW we're going to relate to each other.</p>
<p>Within that conversation it is useful to cover some things that are absolute no-go's. Things that if they happen are huge red-flags.</p>
<p>For example: A common thing I've witnessed is that in the heat of the moment, some people threaten to leave the relationship.</p>
<p>A rule that I have in my relationship that I developed early on with Juliana, is that threatening to leave is absolutely forbidden. Not because it's about control and trying to stop her or me from leaving. But rather that it's about safety. I know that if there is a threat lurking in the background that if things are getting difficult between us then there's a risk that she will leave, it adds a whole other layer of pressure to the relationship that undermines the integrity of it.</p>
<p>So having this agreement in place means that we avoid these types of interactions and it provides the stability and safety that the other person is going to be there and stay in connection no matter what happens. This in itself is a huge plus for navigating difficulties.</p>
<h2>Understand your nervous system / and each others</h2>
<p>The behaviour of shutting down or defending or hiding etc is a nervous system response. It's normal, it's natural, it's healthy.</p>
<p>That said, it can also have unhealthy effects.</p>
<p>This is a fact of being a human. We have nervous systems and we can experience all of those feelings and behaviours.</p>
<p>It is absolutely imperative that you develop awareness of your nervous system response if you are to be in relationship with people.  If you don't know the automatic knee-jerk responses that you are likely to have then you will be stuck with them and not even know why it's happening.</p>
<p>With awareness however, you can gain understanding. You can begin to watch it in real-time and this gives you opportunity to step in and change it.</p>
<p>Instead of going direct to attack mode or hiding mode, you will instead notice the impulse to pull away or the impulse to use threatening language.</p>
<p>From this place, you actually have a choice. You can continue on down that path, or you can pull back, name what is happening for you and choose to remain in connection.</p>
<p>Also, from this moment, you actually have to opportunity to choose to remain in connection with your partner and identify the pattern that is happening. If you understand your own nervous system and your partners, you can clearly articulate what is happening so that it becomes &quot;us-vs-the pattern&quot; instead of me-vs-you.</p>
<p>Once you see it, you can discuss it and it no longer runs the show anymore.</p>
<h2>Courageously bring your vulnerability</h2>
<p>Deep down in us humans it is soft and vulnerable. At the heart of every conflict there is usually a question which is something like &quot;do you still care about me?&quot;</p>
<p>We all interpret the world in different ways. If you do something, it might have a different meaning for me. That can cause me to question if you still care about me.</p>
<p>The quicker that I can courageously go to the heart of my pain and share it, the faster a conflict will diffuse.</p>
<p>If I can honestly search inside and look for the part of me that I'm trying to protect and instead of doing that, bring it forward, it completely changes things.</p>
<p>Something like... &quot;Hey, I'm noticing that I feel scared. I'm afraid that you're not attracted me anymore and I'm afraid of what that means for us going forwards.&quot;</p>
<p>Or... &quot;Hey, I feel angry and I'm telling myself the story that you don't care about me anymore because you did XYZ&quot;</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Get to the feeling you don't want to share.
The sadness. The fear. The Anger. The softness. The vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Bring Curiosity Online</h2>
<p>Curiosity is an actual super-power. If you can manage to find curiosity in a moment of difficulty it will completely change things.</p>
<p>I mean genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>Curiosity that wonders what it might be like to see the world through anothers eyes.</p>
<p>Not curiosity to gain additional ammunition. Curiosity that helps you understand. Deeply. The other person.</p>
<p>Bring it in, next time you feel challenged. In fact, bring it in when you're not feeling challenged and it will make the challenging times easier because you will actually have deeper understanding of one-another and you will have built the muscle of empathy with each other previously.</p>
<p>I hope you give these ideas some consideration. They make a huge difference if you're struggling with conflict that accelerates quickly.</p>

      <title>What Happens When You Stop Treating Your Body Like a Machine</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/shoulder-pain-self-image/"/>
      <updated>2025-10-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/shoulder-pain-self-image/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>A man told me the other day that his shoulder hurt. This is not an uncommon experience for me. I work with people 1:1 to help them resolve issues like this.</p>
<p>What I realised as I spoke to him is that he was viewing his body in a particular way. He was viewing it as separate parts. This part is my shoulder. This part is my back. This part is my knee. Etc.</p>
<p>Again, this is not uncommon. We hear songs early in life, like <em>&quot;head, shoulders knees and toes&quot;</em>. We need to be able to label and box different bits of ourselves for our language and shared understanding.</p>
<p>But this way of seeing yourself can set you up for pain and difficulty in your movement. It's a perception problem and I believe it's at the root of a lot of painful experiences people have in their body's.</p>
<p>To change this situation, there are different ways of seeing yourself which mean that our movement and sense of being alive is more joyful and pleasure-rich.</p>
<h2>Perception influences reality</h2>
<p>Our thinking - the way we imagine ourselves to be - has an influence on the way we function.</p>
<p>Imagine you're a robot and you're lifting your arm towards the ceiling. Notice how that feels.</p>
<p>Now let go of the robot idea and imagine your lungs are filling with warm air. And because warmer air rises, it begins to flow up through your shoulder and your arm and your arm begins to float upward. The higher it rises, the more the warm air gently fills your arm and hand and encourages it to rise all on it's own, up towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>Notice that those 2 experiences are different? Which image requires less effort to lift your arm?</p>
<p>Nothing changed about your physical arm. Your perception of your arm and it's movement changed. This influenced the muscular contraction patterns that guided your arm to move in that way.</p>
<p>Your perception or self-image influenced your physical reality.</p>
<p>If we go back to this man and his perception of himself as individual parts it creates a certain lived experience of movement and sensation.</p>
<p>In this particular way of viewing himself, he was creating pain for himself.</p>
<p>And if you're wondering - yes I AM saying that the way he view's himself creates the pain he's in.</p>
<p>But what could he have done differently? Well, what's the opposite of differentiated parts?</p>
<p>Integrated whole.</p>
<p>That's right, when I can see myself as a whole integrated being (the whole integrated being that I ACTUALLY AM), my life gets a heck of a lot easier. My movement becomes more fluid. I get more coordinated and the quality of my movement improves. I feel more powerful, connected and joyful about life too.</p>
<p>But this isn't just a simple mind trick like the robot vs. warm air.</p>
<p>Changing ones self-image takes practice. Because practice gives you the lived experience that you actually ARE a whole integrated being.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw a real live heart. It had just been taken out of a goat that had been alive moments earlier. It was still &quot;beating&quot;. Though beating is a terrible description.</p>
<p>Rippling with waves is a more apt description. I realised that I had been imagining a heart based on a more mechanical image. I was thinking it was more like a pump. Something that goes thump, thump, thump, thump etc etc.</p>
<p>But seeing the reality of a real live, organic heart completely changed my image. Hearts are beautiful. They produce waves of movement.  They're fluid and smooth and rippling. They are more akin to a musical instrument creating pulsing rhythmic sound.</p>
<p>These are the types of experience that practice can give you. They can help to update your image of what your body actually is. An organic, pulsing, living, fluid, rippling organism that is dynamic and changing and ALIVE.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn the type of practice that can help you see yourself in this more accurate and empowering way, PM me.</p>

      <title>The Art of Unraveling - How to Work with Life’s Knots Instead of Fighting Them</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-tugging-harder-tightens-the-knot/"/>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Do you ever get stuck in the same pattern, repeating yourself over and over, but not being able to escape from it? Maybe it's the same fight you get into with your partner. Maybe it's feelings of anxiety. Maybe it's a sore neck.</p>
<p>I would like to share a metaphor which I believe can shed some light on this cycle.</p>
<p>My work is about process. I see a vast woven tapestry with thousands of interconnected threads.</p>
<p>My first step is to in the beauty and complexity of the whole tapestry. Then I get a sense, somewhere in my gut, that there are knotted areas. Places that, if untangled, could make the whole tapestry even more harmonious and beautiful.</p>
<p>I don't know how to untangle them, but I can feel there's some kind of constriction. Only through curious and specific observation does it become obvious how the knot wants to &quot;unravel&quot;.</p>
<p>If I tug too tightly on one thread, it tightens the whole knot again. It's precision work.</p>
<p>If I rush, I lose the thread. The knot remains.</p>
<p>If I forget the whole while looking at the part, I lose the meaning and cannot progress.</p>
<p>It's a delicate art that honours the process.</p>
<p>How I move through is as important as the outcome itself.</p>
<p>But when the knot is un-done, the whole tapestry takes on a different look. It's more harmonious. More connected. It knows itself better.</p>
<p>This is what practices like Feldenkrais or relational awareness work are about — learning to move through life with sensitivity to process, rather than control of outcome.</p>
<p>Practices that honour the process as much as the outcome. Practices that honour relationship and connection.</p>
<p>If you give yourself the gift of practicing something over and over again with your focus on the <strong>quality</strong> of how you do it, as opposed to &quot;getting the outcome you want&quot;. It will change your life.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>I work in seemingly unrelated fields. I help people with chronic pain and people who want to improve their relationship with their loved ones.</p>
<p>But underneath the hood, it's the same process.</p>
<p>We look at the tapestry, we work with the knots we find and we practice moving with presence, relationship, ease and honesty.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've noticed these knots in yourself before. A stumbling block in your intimate relationship? A parenting struggle? A sore back that just won't respond to what you're doing.</p>
<p>You probably also have a default response to these knots. Maybe you try to stretch your back. Maybe you feel yourself get angry with your kid and then berate yourself later for being too aggressive? Maybe you close off to your partner and pull back until it's passed over.</p>
<p>What if there was a different way of approaching these knots? What if instead of tugging on them desperately, trying to make them disappear, you looked at them patiently and gently. What if your intent was to understand? What if you committed to honouring the WAY that you work with your knot?</p>
<p>You know those values that you admire the most about yourself when things are going well? Maybe it's care, or love, or nurturing. Curiosity, respect or humour.</p>
<p>What might it be like to bring some of these values - your highest values - to the way that you work with your knots?</p>
<p>Next time you notice a knot — in your body, or your relationship — pause. Breathe. Feel it. Then ask yourself: what would it look like to meet this knot while honouring the process?</p>
<p>I’d love to hear what you discover.</p>

      <title>Gentle Honesty - The Art of Speaking Truth Without Breaking Connection</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/gentle-honesty-speaking-truth-without-breaking-connection/"/>
      <updated>2025-10-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/gentle-honesty-speaking-truth-without-breaking-connection/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>You want to be honest. You really do.
You value openness, depth, and truth.</p>
<p>But when it comes to saying what’s <em>really</em> going on for you, your throat tightens, your chest contracts, and suddenly… the words don’t come out right.<br>
You’re not alone in that.</p>
<p>If you notice your body reacting as you read — a little tightness, a sigh, a bit of sadness — that’s okay. It’s just your system recognizing something true.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel like your words would be too much. Maybe you fear the other person will take it the wrong way. Maybe it's difficult to get the words out in a way that matches what you're actually feeling - this used to be a big one for me!</p>
<p>Would you like to be able to have open and honest conversations with more ease? What if you could say what you felt in such a way that you could be proud of your clarity and transparency.</p>
<h2>Cultural Differences in Communication</h2>
<p>My partner is Argentinian and I am from New Zealand. Culturally we are opposites when it comes to communication.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are generally indirect. We do things we think are &quot;polite&quot;. We say sorry even when it's not our fault and we say thankyou until it gets awkward. We use lots of words like &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; that dampen the impact (and therefore the clarity) of what we're about to say. If someone messages us with a request and our answer is no, we just say nothing rather than risk disappointing someone.</p>
<p>Ughh — it feels cringy to even write that. But it’s true. It’s where I came from, and it shaped how I learned to protect myself.</p>
<p>Argentinians on the other hand are direct and fiery. They are not afraid of conflict and they say EXACTLY what's on their minds. My eyes must have been the size of dinner plates the first time I went to Argentina, sitting down to a family dinner. It felt like a full on war was breaking out around me - but to them it was normal.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this difference in expectations and behaviours came up a lot during the early stages of our relationship.</p>
<p>The pattern goes something like this...</p>
<h2>How Our Protection Patterns Collide</h2>
<p>She says something direct and truthful. I interpret it as attack. My defense mechanism of silence and retreat comes online. She gets frustrated because I'm not being clear about what I want. I get more and more withdrawn. She gets more and more direct and frustrated.</p>
<p>OUCH</p>
<p>That was our cycle for a long time. And it hurt — not because we didn’t love each other, but because we were both protecting ourselves in the only ways we knew how.</p>
<p>Your pattern may be different. Different histories, expectations, traumas, cultural norms, gender norms, etc.</p>
<p>These things all impact on couples' abilities to have open, honest, connected and productive conversations.</p>
<p>When these layers combine — culture, upbringing, nervous system wiring — even love can’t override our instinct to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>So what can we do when honesty feels risky — when we <em>want</em> to be open, but our body says no?</p>
<h2>When Safety Disappears, So Does Honesty</h2>
<p>Have you ever been in an environment where it was easy to speak your truth. It flowed out of you and felt effortless. My guess is that you probably felt safe to do so.</p>
<p>Difficulty expressing honestly is directly related to how safe you feel. Those compensations that dilute your meaning only exist because, somewhere deep down, it doesn’t feel safe to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Safety is foundational. Our nervous systems have a neuroception of safety. That is - they're always scanning the environment in the background of our awareness to sense how safe or dangerous it is. When we judge unconsciously that it's safe, we can be in a more socially engaged mode of being.</p>
<p>In this space of safety, truth speaking is natural.</p>
<p>So if you have a background sense in your relationship that it's unsafe to speak the truth. You're going to have to find ways to support yourself to feel safe.</p>
<h2>How to Re-Establish Safety</h2>
<p>Here are some ways I know of that might help re-establish safety - so you can relax.</p>
<h3>Practical Ways to Create Safety Together</h3>
<ul>
<li>Naming the fear to your partner - &quot;I'm feeling afraid to speak the truth right now.&quot; This is a micro act of speaking what's true. It reveals vulnerability. It breaks the spell.</li>
<li>Asking for support - &quot;What would help me feel more safe is if you...&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;...told me you love me.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...let me finish speaking before you speak.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...put your hand on me.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...shared how you're feeling.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...give me your full attention for a few minutes&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...just share the space with me for a few minutes without any pressure to talk.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...reassure me that we're on the same team, no matter what&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identifying the ways in which your own survival mechanisms are operating right now - &quot;I'm finding it difficult to breathe. I'm feeling really shut down. I'm feeling anxious. I have a desire to run away. I have a desire to be very close to you and I'm afraid that I might be too much and scare you away.&quot;</li>
<li>Talk about how it's hard for you to tell the truth sometimes with your partner - probably best done when there is nothing pressing. Engage with curiosity.</li>
<li>Providing you've had this conversation in the past, let your partner know that it's happening for you again.</li>
<li>Have a practice of doing regular check-ins with each other. Get used to speaking vulnerabilities with each other with low stakes. As confidence builds, take bigger risks.</li>
<li>Learn about Nonviolent Communication (NVC). It’s a beautiful framework for expressing what’s alive inside you — your feelings, needs, and requests — in a way that creates understanding rather than distance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know - if you felt your chest tighten just reading the above, it's okay. These things can be scary. But just know you don't have to do it perfectly and you don't have to do it all now.</p>
<p>Small truths spoken with warmth have power beyond what you might imagine right now.</p>
<h2>Building the Muscles of Emotional Honesty</h2>
<p>Here's some things I notice about the suggestions I gave.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is an element of risk and vulnerability involved. It requires being able to summon the courage to take small risks and see how they are received. Paradoxically, taking this leap can lead to feeling safer.</li>
<li>They invite a sense of teamwork into your partnership (which can be one of the first things to leave when it doesn't feel safe).</li>
<li>There's also an aspect of skill building. What is your emotional intelligence like? Your somatic intelligence? How familiar are you with what is happening internally? These skills also impact your ability to express truly what is going on.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Try This Today</h2>
<p>Think of one small truth you’ve been holding back — something gentle but real.<br>
Say it aloud to yourself first.<br>
Notice what happens in your body.<br>
If it feels okay, share it with someone you trust.<br>
Every small act of honesty builds the muscle for the next.</p>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>I encourage you to give these suggestions a try. Investing in the skillset of emotional honesty is something that pays back BIG-TIME.</p>
<p>I have a relationship in which I can share anything about what's going on within me. That level of trust is a huge asset in my life. I know I have someone next to me who's got my back. Someone who, if things get tough, can be there to listen to me. I know that no matter what is going on, she will be there to support. And I know she feels the same way about me.</p>
<p>That's teamwork.</p>
<p>Working as a team to create an environment where emotional honesty is the norm is something that will gradually sculpt your life in ways you cannot predict.</p>
<p>Over time, that honesty fills your cup until it overflows — and what spills out is warmth, connection, and quiet confidence that touches every other part of your life.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of love that doesn’t just stay between two people — it ripples outward.</p>

      <title>Why Your Body Wont Let Go And What You Can Do About It</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-your-body-wont-let-go/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-your-body-wont-let-go/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Do you ever feel like no matter how much you rest, your body never really lets go?</p>
<p>Maybe you stretch, meditate, or get massages, but the relief is fleeting. You feel like you <em>should</em> be able to release tension easily… yet somehow, your body doesn’t cooperate.</p>
<p>If this feels familiar, you’re not broken. It’s actually very human: your brain and nervous system are doing exactly what they’re designed to do. The very systems that keep you alive and safe are also the ones that maintain tension — even when it feels frustrating.</p>
<p>You want your body to relax, yet your nervous system keeps you alert. You want ease, yet your system insists on readiness. This paradox is normal — it’s your biology speaking.</p>
<h2>Why Pushing Harder Backfires</h2>
<p>Many people I see live in a state of constant pushing, trying, and fighting their way forward. Maybe it’s about feeling safe, maybe it’s cultural conditioning — the belief that if you don’t know how to do something perfectly, the answer is to push harder.</p>
<p>I used to be this way too. I trained a lot — until my background tension got so high that I literally couldn’t walk properly anymore. I know how it feels to be trapped in a body that doesn’t let go.</p>
<h2>Tension isn't your fault</h2>
<p>Here’s something to consider: your tension isn’t a personal failing. It’s a systemic response. Your muscles aren’t the problem — they’re just following instructions from your nervous system.</p>
<p>If you have tight neck or back muscles - they are just a symptom. They're not the cause.</p>
<p>The good news about this is that brains are plastic. They can change. And they can change quickly if the conditions are right. It's possible for you to learn how to have a body that feels comfortable and at ease. You can live in a way that it feels simple and enjoyable to just sit there and breathe naturally deep breaths. You can walk up stairs or sleep in your bed in a way that feels like your body is happy to do so.</p>
<p>Maybe even just hearing that is a relief. And I know it's true because I've felt it myself. And I've seen it happen for many of my clients.</p>
<p>The truth is, your brain can feel safe and content in the world, just the way you are right now.</p>
<p>The way to get there requires some learning and some practice.</p>
<p>To give you some idea of what that journey looks like. I'll give you a couple of the key ideas that it's necessary to embody in order to feel this level of ease and freedom.</p>
<h2>Ease is a practice</h2>
<p>In strength training and pretty much any sort of athletic endeavour, the mantra is that you need to continually push your limits. If you did 30 pushups this week, you need to do 32 or 35 next week. In this way, you build up your capacity to do work.</p>
<p>But have you ever tried to &quot;push the limits&quot; of your ease?</p>
<p>What if you had to do reps of a movement, but each time aiming to make it simpler and gentler and easier than the last.</p>
<p>Our nervous systems are built upon patterns or habits. If we practice a particular pattern, it gets easier to us.</p>
<p>If we practice ease, it starts to feel more natural and it becomes our normal.</p>
<p>Just like it’s natural to push harder when you want to improve strength, it’s also natural to resist letting go of tension when your nervous system feels it needs you alert.</p>
<p>The paradox is that the very practice of easing can initially feel like “not doing enough,” even though it’s exactly what your system needs.</p>
<h2>Your Body and Mind are A System</h2>
<p>Have you noticed how it's difficult to tell if the tension you feel is physical or emotional?</p>
<p>Maybe sometimes it feels more physical, maybe others more emotional. Maybe if you didn't sleep well, your body will feel tighter the next day.</p>
<p>This isn't some weird mistake. Since the tension in your body is governed at a central location (ie: your brain) it makes sense that everything affects it.</p>
<p>The truth is, your emotions, your thoughts, your relationships, your food intake, your injuries, your traumas, etc all influence the state of your nervous system.</p>
<p>And when you influence your nervous system in a way that supports it in coming back to calm, you will feel it in all of these domains too.</p>
<p>If you improve the ease of your movement, your muscle tone will soften, your thoughts will become more coherent, your emotional state will feel more positive and on and on...</p>
<h2>A Simple Practice to Invite Deeper Relaxation</h2>
<p>Here's something to try today to give you a sense of what it's like to relax at a nervous system level.</p>
<p>You might notice some resistance at first — your body may “want” to tighten again, or your mind might tell you this isn’t enough. That’s normal. The paradox is: by <em>not pushing</em>, you’re actually training your nervous system more deeply than by forcing movement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lie down and get as comfortable as you can. Use pillows or towels folded underneath your head and anywhere else you feel needs it. Take this step seriously, it makes a difference. With this type of support you're giving your nervous system cues that it is safe and it's okay to let go.</li>
<li>Firstly, pay attention to your breath so you have a baseline for comparison. How fast is it going? Which parts of your body move when you breathe and which parts stay still? How deep does your breathing feel?</li>
<li>Now put one hand on your belly and one hand on your chest.</li>
<li>Take a breath in and hold it. Don't inhale as deep as you can. Maybe 80% of your capacity. Nothing that feels too stressful. Now with a held breath, begin to move your torso in such a way that you move the air up into your chest. Your chest should expand and push your hand out. At the same time, your belly will pull in and your hand will move closer to your spine. Then reverse it so that you push your belly out and your chest goes in. Continue to do this movement alternating with your belly and chest going in opposite directions. Only do this a few times before exhaling again. You don't need to push the limits. Just take it easy.</li>
<li>Repeat this for several cycles - each time trying to do the movement with more ease and less effort. Don't push your limits of how far you can move your chest or belly. Just keep it simple and don't do your best!</li>
<li>Now just allow yourself to breathe naturally.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the way your breath feels now. How fast is it going? Which parts of your body move when you breathe and which parts stay still? How deep does your breathing feel?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are feeling more relaxed and at ease, even just a little bit - you can see how just a few minutes of &quot;practicing ease&quot; can have positive effects on your nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember how I said this was systemic. Notice if there's anything different about how you feel in general. Emotiions. Thoughts. Feelings. Physical comfort.</p>
<h2>Feeling Good is Possible</h2>
<p>As a former &quot;tension-addict&quot;, I can attest to the fact that it's possible to change your patterns.</p>
<p>I used to feel a lot of chronic pain and chronic tension. I know that with some work you can reverse this situation and feel better in your body than ever before.</p>
<p>The encouraging thing is that it doesn't come from working harder. It comes from learning to work in harmony with your nervous system.</p>
<p>You can use curiosity and gentleness to develop a sweet and loving relationship with your body and it will have profound effects on your entire system.</p>
<p>Isn't it a relief to know that progress can come from doing less?</p>

      <title>Boundaries Without Walls - How to Protect Yourself and Stay Connected</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/boundaries-without-walls-protect-yourself-stay-connected/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/boundaries-without-walls-protect-yourself-stay-connected/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Do you ever feel overstimulated around people but you don't want to push them away? You deeply value human connection, yet it all just feels too much sometimes. Maybe you're not sure what to do with these seemingly opposing feelings so you either run away and hide or you suck it up and push through, but then feel terrible later.</p>
<p>It’s confusing, right? You want to be kind. You want to belong. But you also crave quiet, or space, or simply a moment to breathe. You start wondering if something’s wrong with you for needing that.</p>
<p>If that’s you, you’re not alone. Many sensitive people find that the very closeness they crave can also become overwhelming.</p>
<h2>The Common Advice About Boundaries (and Why It Can Feel Harsh)</h2>
<p>You've probably heard things like...</p>
<ul>
<li>“Boundaries are self-care.”</li>
<li>“You teach people how to treat you.”</li>
<li>“Protect your peace.”</li>
<li>“If someone crosses your boundary, cut them off.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps you sense that this angle has an edge of harshness? It aims to create safety through separation. The hidden implication is that connection is dangerous.</p>
<h2>What If Connection and Self-Care Don’t Have to Compete?</h2>
<p>I would like to share an alternative approach which honours both the need for connection and the desire for self care - without making either wrong.</p>
<p>Both matter deeply — and you can learn to meet them at the same time.</p>
<h2>When Boundaries Meet Real Life (and Real People)</h2>
<p>I live with 3 children and my partner. In this situation I have learned the necessity of using boundaries, but I don't have the &quot;luxury&quot; of cutting someone off if they cross them. I also don't want to. I love my children dearly and it's important that they feel attached and secure in their lives.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, my children are wild beasts. Raucous, noisy, unpredictable. At times it feels like every noise my daughter makes is like a knife stabbing into my brain.</p>
<p>It’s hard because the very person I love most is also the source of my overload.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I ask nicely for her to stop or quieten her voice, she ignores me and/or increases her volume.</p>
<p>Sometimes I catch myself snapping, and instantly regret it. Not because I was wrong to set a limit — but because I did it in a way that disconnected us.</p>
<p>The bigger picture here is that she's disregulated and needs an adult ( AKA: me - even though I don't feel very adult in those times) to help regulate her.</p>
<p>Can you identify any situations like this for yourself? Someone is doing something that feels bad for you, but you don't want to hurt them or push them away?</p>
<p>I invite you to just notice what that feels like in your body for a moment before we continue. Does your chest tighten? Do you notice your jaw clench or your breath go shallow?</p>
<p>Now, notice what your typical response would be to this situation and what would that feel like in your body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you justify away your needs so that you can stay in connection?</li>
<li>Maybe you crack and yell out &quot;stop it&quot;!</li>
<li>Maybe you abruptly exit the situation and run away?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know all three of those responses well — the placating, the yelling, and the retreating. None of them feel good afterward.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I invite you to get really clear on how that feels in your body.</p>
<p>What if boundaries didn’t have to be walls, but bridges — ways to stay real and stay close at the same time?</p>
<p>Here's what that might sound like in real life.</p>
<h2>A Different Kind of Boundary Language</h2>
<p>Hey (Name). I really want to stay in connection with you, but I can't right now because (overwhelming behaviour or situation) is happening. If it continues I'm going to have to do (thing that protects you from the situation or behaviour)</p>
<p>For example:
&quot;Hey Aspen (My daughter), I really want to hang out with you, but it's too loud right now and it's hurting my head. If it stays this loud I'm going to have to leave the room or shut the door. What would you like to do?&quot;</p>
<p>What would you say in the situation you're imagining?</p>
<h2>How This Changes the Feel of Connection</h2>
<p>Can you sense the tone of caring? It's about maintaining connection... and it's also protective.</p>
<p>It also doesn't pretend you have no power in the situation. It states clearly what the outcome will be if the person keeps doing that thing.</p>
<p>It gives context to the other person. It lets them know the bigger picture - that you want to be connected.</p>
<p>Maybe the other person had no idea that what they were doing was irritating to you. This is a kind way of letting them know.</p>
<p>Maybe they did know - if that is the case they now know what's going to happen if that continues.</p>
<p>This approach is an integration of the needs of both parts of yourself. The part that desires connection and the part that desires self protection.</p>
<h2>An Invitation to Try It for Yourself</h2>
<p>The beautiful thing about this approach is that you don't have to wait for an overwhelming situation to practice it.</p>
<p>You could think of a small situation today where there's something that is mildy irritating and try the words on for size.</p>
<p>In essence</p>
<ol>
<li>Name that you want connection</li>
<li>Name what you would need for that to improve</li>
</ol>
<p>Heck, you don't even need to have anything irritating. It's actually informative and educational for other people to understand your internal experience regardless of the situation.</p>
<p>Give it a go and let me know how you got on.</p>

      <title>What We’re Really Searching for in Love (And How to Find It)</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/what-were-really-searching-for-in-love/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/what-were-really-searching-for-in-love/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Have you found yourself moving from one relationship to the next, hoping this time you’ll finally find your person — only to watch it unravel again?</p>
<p>You try so hard to make it work. You listen, you communicate, you give your best… yet somehow you never feel deeply seen or valued.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of this, it starts to feel like a pattern — one you can’t quite name or escape. You want to love and be loved, but something keeps slipping through your fingers.</p>
<p>Maybe you've heard advice about what it takes to have a loving relationship...</p>
<h2>The Advice You’ve Probably Heard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop better communication skills.</li>
<li>Love yourself first before anyone else can truly love you.</li>
<li>You have to find the &quot;right person&quot;.</li>
<li>Just keep working at it - relationships take work.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is truth in each of those statements, perhaps there's something deeper and more fundamentally human here at play here.</p>
<p><strong>That something is attunement.</strong></p>
<h2>What Attunement Really Means</h2>
<p>Humans are like instruments. If you're playing the flute and I'm playing the violin we need to play in tune with each other to create harmony.</p>
<p>It's an act of both playing a sound and listening for the others' sound. If we are both playing and both listening, we can find the notes which combine together to create something that sounds beautiful.</p>
<p>Have you had that experience with a person where everything just seemed to click? You're vibing off each other, you feel like the other person really &quot;gets&quot; you and you feel intimately connected - at least for that moment in time.</p>
<p>This is what it's like to be attuned and resonating with someone.  It's alive and exhilarating and it feels deeply rejuvenating.</p>
<h2>The Hidden Skill We’re All Born With</h2>
<p>I believe that this is a powerful and innate part of being human. This ability we have as social animals to be able to connect with each other.</p>
<p>Imagine what it would be like to create this type of connection with your partner consciously. What would that do to your sense of intimacy, connection and trust? Do you think that if this was  normal, you would feel more valued, cared-for and loved?</p>
<p>My experience tells me that resonance is a skill that can be nurtured. And the amazing thing is - it's NATURAL to us. We are wired for this type of connection. It's normal and it's not even a matter of learning anything. It's more about putting down the things that are getting in the way of it.</p>
<h2>How Resonance Begins</h2>
<p><strong>First, simply having the intention to do so.</strong></p>
<p>I used to consider myself a socially awkward person. I thought I wasn't cut out for connection with humans. So when I first started &quot;trying to resonate&quot; with people, I thought it was going to be a difficult and long path of learning some obscure skills that more socially savvy people had.</p>
<p>I was wrong. Within the first moments of just having the intention to do this, I realised that I already knew a lot about it. The resonance began to build immediately. It was built somewhere into my DNA. And it's built into your DNA too. This is human stuff that I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>The second part is the art of presence.</strong></p>
<p>Presence is about noticing what is here right now and being with that. It's the absence of needing to change something, fight it or run away from it.</p>
<h2>A Resonant Moment at the beach</h2>
<p>I met a man the other day at the beach. He was about 60, nearly toothless and extraordinarily enthusiastic. He loved to smile and laugh in close proximity to my face. At first I noticed myself being a bit overwhelmed by his large energy. I recoiled. But as I got present and accepted what was right there, I began to soften. I began to find my groove with this man.</p>
<p>Can you notice what it would be like to just see things as they are, without having to attach any meaning or judgement, any push or pull to the experience.</p>
<p>I could have interpreted this man as obnoxious, or wild or a bit unhinged. But I could also just see it simply as this moment unfolding in front of me. When I did, i started to feel the delight that this man was evidently feeling. I began to come into resonance with him and we shared an enriching experience together.</p>
<h2>An Invitation to Practice</h2>
<p>My invitation to you is to practice this with people. It can be with anyone, anywhere.</p>
<p>Notice yourself and your inner experience. Notice what is coming up for you as this person stands in front of you. Notice any stories you might tell yourself about them, or about yourself. Just let it all be there.</p>
<p>And underneath it all, hold the quiet intention: <em>“I want to be in tune with this person.”</em></p>
<p>Can you see how relating in this way would positively impact the connections in your life?</p>
<p>Once presence, attunement and resonance is in place, everything else — communication, love, trust — naturally begins to fall into place.</p>
<h2>Remembering What Love Really Is</h2>
<p>Attunement isn’t a technique. It’s a remembering — of something ancient, human, and endlessly alive in you. When you slow down enough to feel it, love begins to sound different. It’s less about effort, more about listening. Less about finding the one, more about <em>being</em> one — with yourself, and with whoever stands before you.</p>

      <title>Worried About Your Body’s Asymmetry? Here’s What’s Really Going On</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/worried-about-your-bodys-asymmetry/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/worried-about-your-bodys-asymmetry/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Have you ever noticed one side of your body working harder than the other? It can be a strange moment — like when a client once told me they heard a different sound every time they took a step. That was how they realized something wasn’t quite balanced.</p>
<p>For some people this discovery can be upsetting. Maybe you already take the health of your body seriously and the discovery of an asymmetry feels like something is not quite as healthy as it could be.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've already tried to address it using the common advice of training both sides equally, or training the weaker side more - but realised it doesn't fix anything.</p>
<p>This can feel disempowering - like you don't have any control over the body you exist in.</p>
<h2>The Truth - Everyone is Asymmetrical</h2>
<p>I'm here to tell you that NOBODY escapes asymmetry. In all the people who I've laid hands on, I have found asymmetry in every single one of them. It's normal and natural.</p>
<h2>When Asymmetry Becomes a Problem</h2>
<p>However, some asymmetry can be problematic. If you're still here reading, this may be something you're concerned about. Some asymmetry can lead to chronic pain, tension and discomfort. Many people have a sore hip, shoulder or back on one side.</p>
<p>But how do you know whether it's causing problems? And how do you become more symmetrical? Is it even possible?</p>
<p>I believe I have some answers to the questions. And I hope that by sharing them I encourage you to relate to your body and its differences in a more informed and accepting way.</p>
<p>I also hope to empower you to realise that you do actually have the power to change your body.</p>
<p>But to answer those questions we first need to take a closer look at the way your body and brain work together.</p>
<h2>The Organization of Your Body</h2>
<p>Your nervous system continually monitors information about your body. It knows things like the...</p>
<ul>
<li>bent position of your elbow</li>
<li>pressure of your contact with the floor</li>
<li>temperature of the air on your skin.</li>
<li>inclination of your head</li>
<li>exact location of your shoulder blade</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a LOT of information coming in. Like A LOT!!!</p>
<p>It decides based on that feedback and based on your intentions, how to organize your body.</p>
<p>It's like someone who organizes their bedroom. They decide oh I want a mirror here and my bed here. I want to have my clothes here so that when I get up in the morning I can easily access them. Then I want to keep all my indoor plants out of the way on the window sills so that I don't trip over them when it's dark.</p>
<p>In a similar way, your brain decides oh, I want to go swimming. So when you're in the water it's thinking &quot;okay so my arm needs to bend and move forward and pull me through the water&quot;. where is my arm anyway? Oh yeah there it is. It's a little off from where I thought, so I'm going to add a little more force in this muscle here and that should get the arm back on track again.</p>
<p>It's organizing the force that your muscles produce in order to achieve the positions and movements that you need to get done what you want to get done. And it's trying to do this in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<p>In addition, your brain is monitoring the water temperature, the depth of water, the weather conditions, your perceived danger. And it will adjust things in your organization to suit these perceptions.</p>
<p>This is an astonishingly complex problem that makes the organization of my bedroom seem ridiculously simple (for some reason it doesn't feel this simple!)</p>
<h2>Escaping the Machine-Body Myth</h2>
<p>Why is this frame of understanding important? Because a common cultural view is that of the machine-body metaphor. It’s the worldview that sees the body as something to maintain, fuel, fix, or upgrade. The perspective that we are just a bunch of parts.</p>
<p>It's the reason we have knee doctors and foot doctors and hand specialists and teeth specialists. It's the reason we get hip replacements and knee replacements and breast implants.</p>
<p>This world-view ignores or downplays the fact that we are biological, aware, living organisms.</p>
<p>It ignores the fact that all of your movement and your posture is centrally governed by your nervous system.</p>
<p>If you're coming from the worldview of the body-as-machine. The natural response to asymmetry is to just train the part more. Or move the part differently.</p>
<p>But my experience of this, is that it just doesn't stick.</p>
<p>However, when you're viewing this problem through the (more truthful) lens that we are living, learning organic beings. It becomes more obvious that this problem must be approached at the level of central government. The level of the nervous system.</p>
<h2>If You’ve Tried and Nothing’s Worked...</h2>
<p>So if you're finding yourself...</p>
<ul>
<li>limping, or</li>
<li>your left shoulder is stuck, or</li>
<li>one of your arms swings a lot when you walk while the other is almost stationary</li>
</ul>
<p>..and you don't know what to do about it. Or if you've been doing some training and it's not making a difference.</p>
<p>First of all know that this is not your fault. It's not some personal failing on your part. This way of looking at the body and brain is extremely uncommon. Probably everything you've heard your entire life is more based on this body-as-machine metaphor. At least it was for me.</p>
<p>Secondly, know that this is actually really great news. It it fantastic news actually. Because you have a nervous system that is astonishingly smart — seriously, it’s been fine-tuning your every move since before you could walk. This means that when you learn how to work with it properly, changes can happen fast.</p>
<h2>Some Asymmetry Is Beautifully Normal</h2>
<p>Additionally, I mentioned earlier that not all asymmetry is problematic.</p>
<p>One simple example is that our left lung is smaller than our right. For everyone. The heart sits on the left size of the chest and so there's less room for a lung. natures solution? Smaller left lung.</p>
<p>This changes the shape of our breathing in the left side of our ribcage. This is just one small example of something that isn't balanced.</p>
<p>Another is the people are naturally born right or left handed. We all know this one. We have asymmetric preferences and so it makes sense we use our bodies in ways that aren't balanced.</p>
<p>Hopefully that can also break down the idea that any asymmetry is bad. Because it isn't.</p>
<h2>When the Pattern Gets Stuck</h2>
<p>But some asymmetry is problematic.</p>
<p>An injury which caused you to limp for a period while it healed but then the limp never stopped, is likely a problematic asymmetry.</p>
<p>Maybe you're missing a leg. Or you have scoliosis.</p>
<p>These can be problematic. But it's also possible to learn how to move more optimally regardless of whether your asymmetry is neurological in origin (like the lingering limp), or structural in origin. Like a scoliosis.</p>
<h2>The Key: Re-educating the Nervous System</h2>
<p>Regardless of the state of your body and mind, the only way to resolve the resolveable asymmetries is by exploring it with your senses and upgrading your sensory motor maps.</p>
<p>This process does 2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>It gives your nervous system information about yourself.</li>
<li>Your nervous system uses that information to re-organize.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through the process of sensory and movement exploration, you change.</p>
<p>It's like &quot;diagnosis&quot; and &quot;repair&quot; are both the same step.</p>
<h2>Let Your Brain Do Its Job</h2>
<p>This is like getting clear on household responsibilities. Maybe you're the one who empties the bins, takes out the recycling and does the shopping. Maybe your partner cooks the dinner and walks the dog.</p>
<p>If you start interfering with the process of cooking the dinner, you cause problems. It's not your job. If you neglect to do your job, there wont be ingredients for dinner.</p>
<p>In the same way, if you start trying to fix your asymmetry directly, you won't be able to. It's not your job.</p>
<p>If you neglect to feed your brain good quality ingredients, it won't be able to update your asymmetry.</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>Your job is to feed your brain good quality sensory information.</p>
<p>Your brains job is to reorganize based on that information.</p>
<p>So if you've been struggling with asymmetries which you think are problematic. The approach is about getting better at your job.</p>
<p>Learning how to feed great information into your system is what moves the needle.</p>
<h2>Where Feldenkrais Comes In</h2>
<p>How does someone do that? Glad you asked. This is where feldenkrais enters the picture. Feldenkrais is a methodology which does just that. It is a practice that gradually updates and improves your brains representation of the body.</p>
<p>It deepens coordination, movement efficiency and often will balance out asymmetry's - but only if your nervous system judges that the new &quot;organization&quot; is a better option...which in many cases it is.</p>
<p>If you’d like to experience how this works in your own body, reach out and we can explore what kind of movement practice might help you sense and shift your own patterns.</p>

      <title>Why Sitting at a Computer Doesn’t Have to Ruin Your Posture</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/sitting-at-computer-doesnt-have-to-ruin-posture/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/sitting-at-computer-doesnt-have-to-ruin-posture/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Do you ever catch yourself - maybe in a mirror or just through felt sense - with your shoulders rounded forward?</p>
<p>Or notice your head is jutted forward, as though you were looking closely at a computer screen, even when you're out walking?</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>How does your posture feel in this moment? Feel the weight of your head resting on your spine. No need to correct anything - just notice how your body meets this moment.</p>
<p>What do you notice that surprises you?</p>
<h2>I used to struggle with my posture</h2>
<p>When I was a kid I used to play computer games and I did a stint for a couple of years of computer programming in my early 20's. During this period, despite being very physically active, my posture was less than ideal.</p>
<p>I would slouch, I would hold my head forwards and I would have a lot of tension in my upper back after spending long hours at the computer.</p>
<p>For years I thought posture was something you had to fix — that I’d somehow done it wrong. No matter how hard I tried, the tension always came back.</p>
<p>That experience combined with what I'd heard from society was that computers give you bad posture. I believed it.</p>
<h2>The deeper truth about computer posture</h2>
<p>But what I came to discover through my Feldenkrais training is that it's not actually the computer use which is a problem. It's the way you use yourSELF while you're on the computer that makes a difference.</p>
<p>I still use my computer daily, but now I have a different approach which allows me to have good posture while I'm using it. I also don't &quot;pay for it later&quot; like I used to if I've been on there for a long time.</p>
<p>It's simply a case of learning how to use your body differently.</p>
<h2>Your Posture Comes From The Freedom Or Restriction Of Movement In Your Spine</h2>
<p>Bad posture generally comes from muscles being stuck &quot;on&quot;. That is, they have contracted, and they are not de-contracting.</p>
<p>This is most common in the extensor muscles - the muscles that run down your back and help it arch and stay upright.</p>
<p>When people have back muscles that are free, their posture looks beautiful. Consider a 2 year old. Their posture is perfect and their back muscles are responsive.</p>
<p>When people have habitual contraction in their back, their posture gets messed up. It prevents the little micro movements that healthy vertebrae should have.</p>
<h2>A Healthy Spine Can Flow</h2>
<p>Each vertebra is meant to whisper to the next — passing movement along the way a wave moves through water. When some get quiet, others start shouting.</p>
<p>I invite you to check in with the free movement of your spine right now.</p>
<p>What happens if you exaggerate your slouch for a moment — and then very slowly let it go? Notice which parts of your spine move first, and which hold back.</p>
<p>When you move your spine, can you feel which parts join in easily and which parts seem shy? Try a slow arch, a slow round, maybe even a gentle twist.</p>
<p>Most people notice that some parts are eager while others hesitate — that’s totally normal. Those hesitations are simply the places where your nervous system has learned to “hold on.”</p>
<p>Those hesitations you feel are your nervous system doing what it’s practiced most often. Your spine has developed habits based on those movements it has practiced most.</p>
<h2>Your Spinal Movement is Controlled by Your Habits</h2>
<p>Every adult I know carries some pattern of contraction — it’s just how the nervous system learns to keep us safe. These are the ways that we have learned to use our bodies and they have become so deeply embedded that we don't even think about them anymore. These are our HABITS of contraction.</p>
<p>These habits are unique to each person. They're like a fingerprint.</p>
<p>The way they differ from fingerprints though, is that it's possible to change your muscular habits.</p>
<h2>How Habits are Changed</h2>
<p>It's just like the way you have a habit of brushing your teeth. You do know you always brush the same way right?</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you probably do. You probably start with the same tooth, follow the same sequence and finish in the same way.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change this habit (which can be kinda fun because it feels strange). You first have to notice the way you currently do it. Maybe you do the top right molars first and then move around anti-clockwise to the other teeth.</p>
<p>Then you would have to try out a new sequence. Maybe you choose to brush the bottom teeth first. Then moving up to the top.</p>
<p>You could explore some different sequences and see what feels nicest to you.</p>
<p>Here's the interesting part - if your nervous system likes the new way of brushing your teeth because it's more comfortable or uses less effort, it will adopt the new habit.</p>
<p>You may have to practice it a little in case the old pattern re-asserts it's dominance.</p>
<p>But in essence, this is habit change.</p>
<h2>You Can Change the Movement Habits of Your Back</h2>
<p>The process is no different for changing the habitual movements of your back muscles.</p>
<p>In the same way you brush your teeth in sequence, you’ve got a habitual ‘sequence’ in how your back muscles fire as you stand, sit, or look at a screen.</p>
<p>Once you see that sequence clearly, you can start to explore it and then play with some new patterns.</p>
<p>This is really what posture change is about. It's not about pulling your head back and trying to &quot;fix it&quot;.</p>
<p>When you start to feel how your posture responds to attention instead of effort, you begin to move from fixing to sensing — and that’s where real change begins.</p>
<h2>Play With Your Habit</h2>
<p>In invite you to take a moment now to sense what this process of habit change is like. You can just lower your head a small amount - maybe only 10 or 20% as far as you could go.</p>
<p>Before you move, just notice where your attention rests. Feel the contact your body makes with the chair or the ground. Let yourself arrive.</p>
<p>Slowly move back and forth between being upright and with your head curled forward. As you do this, see if you can identify the way your spine habitually moves... You might ask yourself, &quot;Where is the very first vertebrae that moves?&quot; and then &quot;Whats the sequence of vertebrae that follow?&quot;</p>
<p>Then, when you’re ready, you might experiment with other ways. Perhaps you could initiate the bend from a little further down your spine. Play with it and let some other vertebrae be involved. Let ease be your guide. Could you do this so gently that it becomes a search for joy through your movement?</p>
<p>That's right. Feel the way you can find easy breathing and simplicity as you move back and forth - each time deepening into more softness.</p>
<p>Once your curiosity has run its course, you can bring the movements to a stop. Now there's an opportunity to spend a moment sensing your posture. Is there something softer about it? More gentle? Do you like this way of using yourSELF?</p>
<p>Take a moment to simply feel yourself sitting here now — breathing, alive, supported.<br>
Notice what’s different, even if it’s subtle.<br>
That’s your nervous system learning — through you.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were able to amplify this quality of ease and softness in your posture. How would this change the way you show up while using a computer? Or in other areas of life? How would you see yourself as your move through your life with a softer, more effortless version of posture?</p>

      <title>Beyond Rehab - Growing Your Capacity After Injury</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/beyond-rehab-growing-your-capacity-after-injury/"/>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>I once entered a martial arts tournament and came away with an injury to my hand. 12 months later my knuckle still hurt every time I moved it. Every time I knocked it on something I would feel disappointed that I still hadn't healed properly.</p>
<p>Perhaps you too have had injuries that didn't heal the way you might expect. Whether you trusted your body to heal by itself, or you gave it additional support in the form of exercises, stretching or gentler movement - the process might have taken much longer than you anticipated.</p>
<p>And perhaps, as is so common, the end result was a body part that was slightly less mobile, slightly less functional than before the injury. It can feel like the slow movement of time gently taking it's toll bit by bit.</p>
<p>If you're anything like me, you value the movement of your body. The way it can jump and run, the joyful way it can play, the satisfying way it can do hard things like lifting a heavy rock. You probably want to extend the life of the one body you have for as long as humanly possible. I know I do.</p>
<p>But this process of injury rehabilitation seems to always end a little bit worse off than we were before. It seems that if you accumulate enough injuries over your life that inevitably you will end up old and crunchy before your time.</p>
<p>This fate has never felt satisfying to me. I would love to have a free, healthy, strong, flexible and trustworthy body right to the day I die.</p>
<p>How do you envision <em>your</em> body as you move towards the later stages of life?</p>
<h2>A new way forward in life</h2>
<p>If I am to move forward in a way that feels satisfying, I need to write a different story. One that goes beyond the act of <strong>rehabilitating</strong> (because as you'll see in a minute, I don't believe this is enough)</p>
<p>The new way forward that I'm proposing is called...</p>
<p><strong>Crescentia Potentiae</strong></p>
<p>Tada!!! I know - it sounds like a Harry Potter spell. But hear me out.</p>
<p>If we look at the latin roots of the word <em>rehabilitation</em> we get</p>
<p><em><strong>re</strong> → again</em><br>
<em><strong>habilitare</strong> → &quot;to make fit&quot;</em></p>
<p>So rehabilitation means to make fit again. The implication is that you were fit. Then you got injured, now we need to restore your ability again.</p>
<p>The limitations - as with any viewpoint - are hidden in the unspoken implications of that viewpoint.</p>
<p>In this case - <em><strong>&quot;you've already peaked and the goal is to get you back to where you were&quot;</strong></em></p>
<p>It's sneaky. But now that we've spotted it, we can choose a different way.</p>
<p><strong>Crescentia Potentiae</strong> on the other hand conveys something far more alive. The latin roots are:</p>
<p><em><strong>crescere</strong> → “to grow, increase, arise.”</em><br>
<em><strong>potentia</strong> → “power, ability, capacity, potential.”</em></p>
<p>What if your injury was an opportunity to <strong>grow</strong> your capacity, to <strong>increase</strong> your potential, to <strong>evolve</strong> your ability?</p>
<p>The implication here is that you will go beyond your ability prior to your injury. It just keeps getting better!</p>
<p>Take a moment and breathe <em>that</em> one in. Feels good right!?</p>
<p>Does that feel like a good fit for progression into old age? If so, then let us continue this discussion.</p>
<h2>How do we keep evolving?</h2>
<p>What does it take to go from simple rehab to crescentia potentiae?</p>
<p>Well rehab requires a period of rest for an injury to heal. General advice also advocates for gradually increasing the amount of load on your body part so that it can start to function normally again.</p>
<p>Basically: don't overdo it until the pain stops and you can start participating in the activity you were involved in before.</p>
<p>I think these are great. They make sense.</p>
<p>And... they're mechanical solutions that address the tissues. Let the tissue heal. Strengthen the tissue. It's purely mechanical. Again, there is limitation by the viewpoint.</p>
<p>They ignore the fact that those body parts are from a living organic system. An organic system that is integrated with a nervous system.</p>
<p>Your brain.</p>
<p>If we include this missing part of the picture, it allows us to align more with our true nature. As living, learning, intelligent organisms. Organisms that can adapt and evolve and improve.</p>
<p>What I propose is that <strong>training your nervous system</strong> is crucial if you want crescentia potentiae</p>
<p>This is the thing that will improve your ability beyond what it was originally. It will also reduce the likelihood that you'll hurt yourself again.</p>
<p>And it doesn't need to wait until an injury to get started either.</p>
<h2>What is nervous system training?</h2>
<p>When human babies are born, they suck at moving - they can't even focus their eyes. Other animals by contrast can get up and run within minutes of their birth.</p>
<p>What human babes excel at, is learning. Our nervous systems are wired fundamentally differently. The reason we suck is also the reason that long term we are such adaptable creatures. We have a lot more flexibility built into the system.</p>
<p>We're like clay that stays soft. A baby zebra hardens fast — it’s shaped and set within minutes. We stay malleable for years, which means we can be reshaped, reformed, and reimagined countless times over a lifetime.</p>
<p>But just because we have this ability, it doesn't mean we make the most of it.</p>
<p>Nervous system training takes our unique human gifts and leverages them so that we can keep evolving.</p>
<p>It is a process of consciously using our senses to improve the way we move. It's about using our in-built capacity to learn, to soften</p>
<p>This type of training deeply changes the way an injury heals.
Why?</p>
<h2>Pain interferes with healthy movement</h2>
<p>Pain changes the way we move — and not just because it hurts.<br>
It changes the way our brain <em>maps</em> our body.</p>
<p>Every movement we make relies on an internal map — a constantly updating sense of where each part of us is in space. When we get injured, the brain blurs that map around the painful area to protect it. It’s as if the lights dim there. The problem is, when that dimming stays too long, we lose coordination, accuracy, and confidence in how we move that part.</p>
<p>So even when the tissues have healed, the <em>programming</em> hasn’t.<br>
You’re left with a slightly scrambled line of communication between brain and body.</p>
<p>That’s why nervous system training matters.<br>
It’s how we <strong>brighten the map again</strong>.</p>
<p>Through gentle, precise awareness-based movement, we feed the brain new information — richer sensory data that helps it recalibrate. The pain quiets not because we’ve forced the body to be stronger, but because the brain <em>trusts it again.</em></p>
<p>That’s when <em>crescentia potentiae</em> starts to happen.<br>
We’re not just repairing damage; we’re upgrading the system.<br>
The coordination improves, movements become more efficient, and the risk of re-injury drops — because the old faulty pattern that led to the problem in the first place has evolved into something new.</p>
<p>This is what separates mechanical rehab from organic growth.<br>
One restores function.<br>
The other expands possibility.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you tell if your “map” needs updating?</strong></h2>
<p>There are little clues — subtle signs that your nervous system hasn’t fully integrated a part of you yet.<br>
You might notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>A feeling of stiffness or restriction that doesn’t match the actual injury.</li>
<li>Movements that feel cautious or jerky, like your body’s second-guessing itself.</li>
<li>A strange lack of sensation — parts of you that feel fuzzy, dull, or absent.</li>
<li>Or the opposite: a part that’s <em>too loud</em>, overprotective, quick to flare up.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all signs that the communication between your brain and body could use refinement — not through pushing, but through re-learning.</p>
<h2>A few examples</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ankle that never quite trusted itself again.</strong><br>
A man sprains his ankle, goes through rehab, and regains strength — yet months later he still avoids walking at heights. When he learns to sense the movement of his toes, knees, and hips in relation to each other, the nervous system rebuilds trust. Within weeks, his balance returns, and his gait feels smoother than before the injury.</li>
<li><strong>The jaw that feels tight on one side</strong><br>
A woman with a lifelong jaw issue after a childhood trip to the orthodontist gone wrong. When she slows down enough to pay attention to the pathway of her jaw through space, the tension melts. Immediately her range increases without strain, she discovers a new ease she never had before — even pre-injury.</li>
<li><strong>The chronic neck pain that began after a single awkward lift.</strong><br>
Years later, the tissue has long healed, but the brain still perceives vulnerability. Through mindful micro-movements and re-mapping the ribcage and it's relationship to the head. What replaces it is a new coordination — lighter, more efficient, more integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stories are about more than recovery.<br>
They’re about evolution.</p>
<h2>An invitation</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever felt betrayed by your body — by its slowness to heal, by its recurring pain, by the creeping sense of limitation — I want to offer a new possibility.</p>
<p>What if this isn’t decline?<br>
What if it’s <em>an invitation to grow more skillful</em>?</p>
<p>To become more precise, more attuned, more alive in your own skin.</p>
<p>That’s the path of <strong>Crescentia Potentiae</strong>.<br>
It’s not about getting “back” to who you were. It’s about becoming someone new — someone more integrated, more fluid, more capable than before.</p>
<p>Every movement you make is a chance to re-educate your nervous system, to refine the dialogue between awareness and action.<br>
To <em>grow your potential</em> from the inside out.</p>
<p>So instead of asking, <em>“How do I get back to normal?”</em><br>
Try asking, <em>“What new capacity is trying to emerge?”</em></p>
<p>That’s the seed of lifelong vitality.</p>
<h3><strong>Coming Full Circle</strong></h3>
<p>When I think back to that martial arts injury — the stubborn ache in my knuckle that lingered for months — I see now that what frustrated me most wasn’t the pain. It was the <em>story</em> I was living inside.<br>
The story that said, <em>I used to be whole, and now I’m slightly less.</em></p>
<p>But what if that’s never been true?<br>
What if every injury, every strain, every small limitation is the body’s way of saying, <em>“There’s more intelligence available here — if you’re willing to learn.”</em></p>
<p>In that light, healing becomes less about fixing what’s broken and more about refining what’s possible.<br>
And growing older becomes less about decline and more about evolution — the gradual, graceful deepening of coordination, sensitivity, and wisdom.</p>
<p>That’s what I want for myself: a body that’s not only strong, but <em>well-listened-to.</em><br>
One that continues to surprise me with new ease and subtlety.<br>
A nervous system that’s still curious, still learning, still reshaping itself right to the end.</p>
<p><strong>Crescentia Potentiae</strong> isn’t a technique — it’s a relationship.<br>
A relationship with your own capacity to grow.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself in pain, or healing slower than you hoped, take heart. You haven’t missed your peak — you’ve just reached the next invitation.<br>
The next opportunity to grow your potential.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, awareness by awareness, you’re not just repairing the past —<br>
you’re shaping the future of how you live inside your body.</p>
<p>And maybe that’s the real gift of being human:<br>
We never truly “set.”<br>
We keep softening, sensing, learning, evolving —<br>
until our very last breath.</p>

      <title>When Your Partners Words Feel Like an Attack</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/when-your-partners-words-feel-like-attack/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/when-your-partners-words-feel-like-attack/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Have you ever had your partner say something to you, which seemed like they were attacking you?</p>
<p>Maybe you felt criticised or &quot;made wrong&quot; for something. It could have been the words, the tone of voice or maybe even a facial expression that made you feel that way.</p>
<p>In that moment, did your defences come up? Did you then move towards justifying or explaining yourself? Or what about disproving or minimizing what your partner said?</p>
<p>This has happened to me. I can think of numerous times my partner has said something to me and it has felt like she was criticising or attacking me.</p>
<p>My <strong>instant</strong> <strong>knee-jerk response</strong> is to <em>defend</em> and / or <em>defuse</em> the situation. Some deeply in-built safety mechanism jumps on board and starts to control the show.</p>
<p>Sometimes this has involved explaining why her reasoning isn't correct. Other times it might be denial or minimisation.</p>
<p>Overall, this type of situation ends up creating disconnection and pain for both of us. It's not a lot of fun. And the fascinating thing is, in <em>many</em> cases, once we get to the bottom of it, there was never any intention to attack.</p>
<p><strong>This whole drama unfolds, yet the intention was never about attack.</strong></p>
<p>Has this happened to you before? It's totally understandable if it has. I believe these defense mechanisms are deeply in-built and it's easy for them to spark up when it feels like a threat is approaching.</p>
<p>Thankfully, over the 5 years that I have been with my queen, I have managed to bring enough awareness to my side of this pattern that it rarely occurs anymore. When it does begin, I now know how to stop it before it creates any disconnection.</p>
<p>In fact, I have flipped it so much, that I now can use it as a springboard for MORE connection.</p>
<p>Seriously, when something starts off like this now, I am confident it will end with Juliana and I knowing each other better. There's softness and empathy and compassion. It's a sweet place to be.</p>
<p>Could you imagine what it might be like to know that <strong>whatever happens, you end up closer to your partner instead of further away</strong>? I wonder how that might alter the trajectory of your relationship long term...</p>
<p>I don't know your situation. You might have these skills pretty much mastered and just be looking for some fine tuning. Or on the other hand, you might feel yourself as volatile and reactive to the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>In any case, I would like to share some of the skills and mindsets I have learned which have allowed me to navigate this more harmoniously.</p>
<p>I believe that learning skills like this can help us stay connected and loving with the people we love the most. Which benefits everyone!</p>
<p>I'm going to share a way to stay on the same team with your partner. An approach which soothes the war reaction (for both people) and re-orients you towards the goal of building deeper foundations together.</p>
<p>Pain is never meant to drive people apart, it should bring them closer together!</p>
<h2>Noticing The Truth Of What Just Happened</h2>
<p>2 days ago, my partner said <em>&quot;can you please come and help me with Aspen, I asked for your help over an hour ago&quot;</em>. She says this with a tone of voice that seems like she's frustrated at me.</p>
<p>The next little micro-moment, I felt my defense system come online.</p>
<p>What this tells me (after having felt this many times) is that...</p>
<ul>
<li>I've made some untested assumptions.</li>
<li>I'm telling myself some stories about what just happened.</li>
<li>I'm making her emotional state mean something about me.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I'm making her emotions about ME the human, not simply my behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all useful truths to acknowledge. However, in the moment when my defenses come up, my inner landscape can feel quite intense. So it's not always easy to begin with rationally unpacking this stuff.</p>
<p>I find the most helpful <em><strong>first step</strong></em> <strong>is to simply acknowledge to myself that my defenses have just come on board</strong>. Naming that truth usually gives a slight break in the intensity. It stops the pattern from being &quot;knee-jerk-reaction&quot; and puts it into my hands as something to respond to.</p>
<p>I often find, the next best step is to acknowledge the same thing to my partner.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Oooff, I just noticed myself getting defensive&quot;</em></p>
<p>Immediately this shows vulnerability. It's truthful. It is indisputable. It's usually appreciated.</p>
<p>Already, the pattern begins to break and I'm staying connected. There can be no war without warriors.</p>
<h2>Slow Everything Down</h2>
<p>The biggest battle you'll fight in these situations is the speed at which they can escalate. These primitive survival reflexes are FAST. They need to be. That's why they have helped you survive.</p>
<p>But in this context, the speed is unhelpful. We don't want to stay teetering on the edge of a cease-fire. We want deeper connection.</p>
<p>So lets add to what I've said already...</p>
<p><em>&quot;Oooff, I just noticed myself getting defensive, can we slow down for a sec? I want to hear you, but I’m having a reaction.”</em></p>
<p>This signals to the other person that...</p>
<ul>
<li>You care about hearing them.</li>
<li>You're struggling in this moment and you need slowness.</li>
<li>You want to stay in connection, despite it being hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are powerful messages. Powerful to send, and to receive. By communicating this, you'll likely find that everything inside you <em>does</em> begin to slow down, regardless of your partners response.</p>
<p>From this place, you have more agency to choose intelligent steps forward that are going to create even deeper levels of connection.</p>
<h2>Explore Where to Take The Conversation</h2>
<p>Your partner was likely communicating with you for a good reason. They may have some feelings, needs and stories they would like to express with you. They may simply want to know deep down that you still care about them.</p>
<p>At the same time, you also have stories, emotions and needs swirling around.</p>
<p>Both of you need time and space to express these or process them in some way. How you do that is going to be context dependent.</p>
<p>I find often that the following points may need to be explored. Sometimes there is overlap between them and sometimes by addressing one of them, the other parts unravel through that process. Start wherever makes sense and navigate with care and attention.</p>
<h2>Exploration 1: Address the unmet needs and feelings of your partner</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier. Maybe your partner has some unmet needs and some feelings. Sometimes all that is required is to give those some attention.</p>
<p>In my example, my partner just needed some support and some time child-free.</p>
<p>By saying something like this...</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey I'm wondering if there was something you needed which I might have missed. Would you be open to sharing that with me?&quot;</em></p>
<p>...it gives your partner space to express what is really beneath the words.</p>
<p>You may find by listening deeply, that it actually makes a lot of sense why they communicated in the way they did.</p>
<p>The truth was, my partner needed some help. She was exasperated. Great. This wasn't about me and my &quot;incompetence&quot;.</p>
<p>Speaking of...</p>
<h2>Exploration 2: Recognise This May Not Be Criticism</h2>
<p>There are many reasons I could have felt defensive. In my example... My brain is adding  meaning to what she's said.</p>
<p>She said &quot;I asked you over an hour ago&quot;</p>
<p>This is true. She did ask me over an hour ago.</p>
<p>But I'm adding, &quot;And I'm so pissed off that I've had to ask you again. You're being disrespectful, self centered and lazy&quot;</p>
<p>In NLP this is known as distortion. This is what humans do. We distort, delete and generalize information coming in, to fit particular narratives that we have about ourselves.</p>
<p>In my case, I've been judged as lazy before. It's deep conditioning. So when there's a slight indication that she might be thinking I'm lazy... my brain distorts it to fit that pattern.</p>
<p>All of this happens in an instant.</p>
<p>But since I've named the defensiveness already, it means we now at least have the breathing space to explore WHY I felt defensive based on what she said. What was it that I was assuming? What stories was I telling myself? Where did I distort, generalise or delete information?</p>
<p>These are all useful places to enquire.</p>
<p>And I suggest (if you're both up for it) - to do it together. To frame it up like this...</p>
<p><em>...I'm feeling defensive. There's a possibility that you said something that was intentionally hurtful. There's also a possibility that I heard what you said and <strong>interpreted</strong> it as hurtful. In either case, lets explore honestly together what the intention was behind your words. And lets explore the way the words landed in <strong>me</strong> and how I might have unintentionally warped them in some way.</em></p>
<p>Discussions like these are GOLD. These are the places where you get to understand some of your partners deepest pains and most beautiful gifts. These will provide opportunities to bring up memories of pivotal events in each others lives. The moments that shape us and our perceptions of the world.</p>
<p>My encouragement is to do this lightly, as lightly as possible.</p>
<p>This isn't about proving any points.</p>
<p><strong>It's hardcore pure curiosity :)</strong></p>
<h2>Exploration 3: Re-Anchoring in your own Worth</h2>
<p>As you explore this territory together, you may find that there are some really deep stories about yourself that get revealed. Beliefs that we originally formed in difficult times in order to get us through. For example, I'm not worthy. I'm not valuable. I have to be nice to people otherwise I won't belong...etc. etc.</p>
<p>These stories are usually at the heart of why the attempted communication from your partner stung in the first place.</p>
<p>It's actually just that they touched a place within you that was a little tender.</p>
<p>If you've successfully managed to setup a conversation around this with a container of caring and honesty and curiosity... most of the hard work is done. As you discover these deeper root causes, you'll probably start to recognize that they aren't true.</p>
<p>If you can see that it's just an old story you've been telling yourself and it isn't the truth, that can take a lot of the charge out of the situation. It can allow you to see yourself and the other person with less of that distortion.</p>
<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, I’m guessing you’ve lived some version of this dynamic too — that weird mix of love and panic where one tiny moment suddenly feels much bigger than it needs to be.</p>
<p>I honestly wrote all of this because I know how easy it is for me to get swept up in that rush. One second Juliana says something, the next second my chest tightens, and my mind is busy building a whole courtroom drama that… wasn’t actually happening.</p>
<p>And the surprising thing is, the more I’ve slowed those moments down, the more I’ve realised the “problem” was rarely the moment itself.
It was the old story underneath it.<br>
The part of me that wanted to protect something tender.</p>
<p>What’s shifted things for us hasn’t been a perfect skill or a tidy technique — it’s been a posture. A way of meeting those charged moments with a tiny bit more honesty, a tiny bit more breath, a tiny bit more curiosity.</p>
<p>Just enough to catch myself.  Just enough to stay here instead of slipping into that defensive autopilot I know so well.</p>
<p>And from that place, something beautiful starts to happen.<br>
Not instantly. Not magically.<br>
But consistently.</p>
<p>The tension softens.<br>
The humanity comes back.<br>
We actually <em>see</em> each other again.</p>
<p>And honestly… that’s what I want most for anyone reading this. Not some polished communication strategy, but the felt sense that you can stay with yourself — even when you’re triggered — and offer your partner the same thing.</p>
<p>Because when you do that?  Conflict doesn’t have to pull you apart anymore.  It can actually be the doorway into knowing each other better.</p>
<p>So if there’s one thing you carry forward, maybe let it be this:</p>
<p><strong>You’re not trying to “handle conflict.”<br>
You’re learning to stay awake and open in the moments when your body wants to close.</strong></p>
<p>Everything good grows from there.</p>
<p>And if you practise this — gently, imperfectly, over time — those moments that used to feel scary might just become the moments that bring you two closer than you imagined.</p>

      <title>The Real Reason Your Body Feels Stiff and Sore — and What Actually Helps</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/the-real-reason-your-body-feels-stiff-and-sore/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/the-real-reason-your-body-feels-stiff-and-sore/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>A man told me the other day that wherever you press on his body, the muscles will be sore. He seemed bewildered. He clearly didn't like feeling that way, but he didnt know what to do about it. He was about 40 years old, and I could sense through his words he was fearing what life might be like in the future if something didn't change.</p>
<p>When I was in my early 20's suffering through my bout of chronic pain, my entire body hurt whenever you push the muscles. I remember feeling sad about that fact too. I couldn't understand why. I was someone who practiced yoga and martial arts. I thought I was quite in touch with my body, but my body was telling me otherwise.</p>
<p>I tried many different ways to &quot;fix&quot; this problem. Most notably trigger point therapy self massage. This involved finding the little painful knots in the muscles and massaging them multiple times a day. This definitely gave relief. But it never lasted. A day or two later, the pain would be back.</p>
<p>At one point I even created a <strong>spreadsheet</strong> ( yes, that's how far I took it!!! ) so I could hit every one of my trigger points daily. By this stage it was taking me hours of massaging myself each day. But the relief was only temporary. I was frustrated and upset when all of my diligent work was not helping in the slightest.</p>
<p>Maybe you know what this is like, with a body that is more tense than you feel it &quot;should&quot; be? Perhaps there's things you've tried, but nothing has really made any meaningful difference.</p>
<p>I would like to offer some insight into this situation. Because now with much more life experience and some training, I see things differently.</p>
<p><strong>I now know that muscular tension and pain is a product of the nervous system.</strong></p>
<p>That's right. It's a brain thang.</p>
<p>The reason my self-massage wasn't working was because I wasn't addressing the nervous system. I was working on a mechanical level as though the part needed some work.</p>
<p>But I now know this experience is systemic. All of myself is involved in the pain and stiffness that occurs in my parts.</p>
<p>Why is that significant?</p>
<p>Because we're not compartmentalised. We're organic, interconnected beings. And it means the approach to improving the experience of being alive in our bodies needs to be approached holistically too.</p>
<p>Addressing the chronic background pain actually involves a deep look at the way I relate to life itself. The attitude and approach I have to life manifests physically in the body I inhabit. Which I know... it's a little woo if you think about it.</p>
<p>So lets get a little more concrete</p>
<h2>Try This To Feel Your Brain in Action</h2>
<p>I have got a little exercise for you to do. The purpose is to show you your own nervous system in action. It may also reveal some of your habits and ways of approaching life that you weren't aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sit on a chair with your hands resting on your knees. Sense the distance from your right shoulder to your right ear-lobe. Now the left. Compare the two... which one is a larger distance? Don't look, just feel internally. &quot;I don't know&quot; is also valid.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lift your right shoulder in the direction of your right ear. Then lower it down again to move further away from your ear. Notice... did you attempt to move as far as you can? Try it again, but this time do it slowly and only move through a comfortable range. Keep repeating, but try to make it easier and smoother each time you move. Feel the way your shoulder blade slides over your ribs at the back and your collar bone lifts up at your shoulder end. Do 5 or 6 movements with full attention.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Take a brief rest and then begin to move your right shoulder in the forwards / backwards direction. Move with as much ease as you can muster. Notice how your shoulder blade moves differently in this direction. It slides around the side of you and then draws closer to your spine in the middle. Can you still find a way to breathe simply while doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Take another brief rest and then do a circular movement which connects all 4 points. Up. Down. Forwards. Backwards. Go slow and with precision! Feel how circular your movement actually is. If you go slow enough you'll notice the circle actually has lumps and straight lines. It may feel jerky in some areas and smooth in others. Your shoulder likely jumps over certain parts of the circle. You don't need to fix it, but just notice the truth of how your shoulder actually moves.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Just rest now and begin to sense the distance from your shoulders to your earlobes. It has changed. What is the difference now between the left and the right? Which shoulder feels more comfortable? If you didn't know in the beginning, is it clearer now?</p>
<h2>What Has That Got To Do With Pain and Tension?</h2>
<p>If you followed along with that exercise you will have experienced a taster of what it's like to move with attention. In the few minutes that you did so, you would have likely experienced an improvement (albeit a small one) in your movement.</p>
<p>You are likely more aware of how your shoulder works in conjunction with your shoulder blade and your collar bone. Perhaps even your ribcage and breathing.</p>
<p>Your shoulder probably sits just the slightest bit more comfortably than it did prior to those movements.</p>
<p>The distance from your shoulder to the earlobe may have grown as your shoulder allowed itself to be held up by your skeletal structure.</p>
<p>If you're sharp, you may feel there's less tension and possibly a change in the quality of movement in your breathing on the right side.</p>
<p>All of that happened while simply doing some basic movements of your shoulder.</p>
<p>There was no stretching, strengthening or massage involved. Yet the function improved.</p>
<h2>Working With The Nervous System</h2>
<p>This experience is a taster of what it's like to upgrade the nervous systems programming of your shoulder movement.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, there were areas that felt clunky, jerky, vague and irregular. These are places where our brain doesn't have reliable sensory information about our shoulders and therefore it doesn't have really precise fine-grained control of how to move it easily.</p>
<p>When we pay attention in this way, we give our brains the opportunity to upgrade the movement programming we have. We feed it sensory information and unnecessary tension begins to drop away.</p>
<p>If you extrapolate this further - by doing more in-depth explorations - it begins to undo the systemic background tension and pain that many people carry around in their bodies.</p>
<h2>Take This Attitude With You To Improve Your Movement</h2>
<p>If you're like 99.9% of people, when I asked you to <em>move your shoulder towards your ear</em> - you moved it as far as you could on the first go.</p>
<p>I'm not going to unpack the full implications of that here, because it's a whole <em>can-o'-worms</em> related to the societal conditioning of &quot;doing well&quot;.</p>
<p>But the more relevant point I would like to uncover, is that when you do less, you actually FEEL so much more.</p>
<p>When you go to your limit, you feel your limit. When you do less, you can feel the process of how you got there.</p>
<p>This is a profound difference when it comes to your human setup. Nervous systems are built to thrive with more sensory information. When we don't try so hard, we give our nervous systems what they need. Everything begins to function better when this becomes the normal.</p>
<p>Pain will drop away. Tension will disappear. Movement will become fluid and delicious.</p>
<p>So if you take anything away from this article, let it be this...</p>
<p><strong>Don't try so hard. Feel more.</strong></p>
<h2>Where to From Here</h2>
<p>What you felt in your shoulder is just the beginning. It’s a tiny doorway into a different relationship with yourself—one where your nervous system is an ally rather than a silent saboteur.</p>
<p>You don’t need to “fix” your body. You need to give it better information.</p>
<p>So play with this. Explore small movements. Notice what changes when you stop pushing and start sensing.</p>
<p>Every time you choose ease over effort, your nervous system rewrites its script.<br>
You’re not just moving differently—you’re relating to life differently.</p>

      <title>If You’re Tired of Hurting, Read This- The Missing Piece in Chronic Pain Recovery</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/tired-of-hurting-missing-piece-in-chronic-pain-recovery/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/tired-of-hurting-missing-piece-in-chronic-pain-recovery/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Are you experiencing ongoing pain? Maybe your back is hyper-sensitive and gets tweaked easily. Or maybe there's a particular part of the movement of your shoulder that you can feel yourself bracing before you get to it.</p>
<p>If this has been your reality for a decent while now, then you'll probably be familiar with how much it interferes with day-to-day life.  Perhaps starting a chainsaw, lifting your grandchildren, or even going for a walk is feeling like a struggle.</p>
<p>Things that you never even used to think about now give you a little stinging reminder each time you attempt them.</p>
<p>I know what this is like, I struggled with crippling chronic pain in my early 20's, so I'm completely familiar with the way it shrinks your life.</p>
<p>In case you were fed-up with all of this, and wondering if and when it's ever going to end, I am here to tell you it can.</p>
<p>The reason I know this, is because it happened for me, and it's happened for my clients.</p>
<p>I understand a bit about pain that the average person on the street doesn't. And it makes all the difference in how to approach it for true, long-lasting recovery.</p>
<p><strong>And here’s the key thing to understand: if pain is a protective habit, then recovery is about showing your brain new evidence that movement is safe again.</strong></p>
<p>So let’s unpack what that actually means.</p>
<p>Because frankly, much of the typical advice I see about it...welll...... I just don't think it goes deep enough. Exercise, stretching and strengthening don't address the most important part in my opinion.</p>
<p>So if you're feeling a bit fed-up with this lingering pain and you want to really understand how to shift it, then read on.</p>
<p>Caveat: If you have got a pretty serious structural issue going on, this approach may NOT be enough. In some cases, more extreme measures are required. For example, I know a guy who had some extreme degradation between a couple of the bones in his foot. He needed surgery to change things. For most people, in most situations though, this approach works.</p>
<h2>Understand The Simple Principles of Pain</h2>
<p>Here are 3 simple principles of pain. Let's unpack them together.</p>
<p><strong>Principle #1:</strong> Your pain comes from your brain.<br>
<strong>Principle #2:</strong> Pain is your brains way of protecting you.<br>
<strong>Principle #3:</strong> Pain can be learned, like any habit.</p>
<p>If you prick your finger on a cactus, your brain creates pain as a way of protecting you. It tells you to move your body away from the spike.</p>
<p>This is great. This type of pain is adaptive. It serves your life well and you WANT it to be there. Without it, you will die well before your time. Seriously, it's a thing. Some people cannot feel pain and it doesn't end well for them.</p>
<p>Lets say you sprain your ankle, your brain makes your ankle hurt to protect you. That is, it makes it hurt every time you step on that foot because it wants you to NOT step on it while it's healing. It doesn't think that force going through your foot is going to help it heal.</p>
<p>Again, this pain is good. It serves your life.</p>
<p>However, our nervous systems are fantastic at learning things. Unfortunately, pain is one of those things.</p>
<p>If your ankle has been hurting for some time, your brain starts to learn that that's normal. Every time you move your hip into that particular position, your body whacks the pain button.</p>
<p>A pavlovian response is setup.</p>
<p>That position = that pain.</p>
<p>If you feel it over and over and over, of course there is going to be a neurological link that forms.</p>
<p>This is one of the entry points into ongoing pain.</p>
<p>There are other entry points. We are organic, systemic beings. What influences our minds, relationships, emotions, circumstances etc, also affects our levels of pain.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that when you don't sleep well that your pain is worse.</p>
<p>Is this making sense to you?</p>
<p>Some of this may feel familiar in your body, and some might feel surprising. Either way, these principles guide the way out of pain.</p>
<h2>How Do We Use These Principles to Get Out of Pain?</h2>
<h3>Provide Safety For Your Brain</h3>
<p>As I said in principle #2. Pain is your brains way of protecting you.</p>
<p>Which means, it's actually trying to keep you safe.</p>
<p>This is crucial for responding to and getting out of pain.</p>
<p>Whatever strategy is used needs to build safety. Your brain is feeling on-edge. It's not 100% safe feeling right now. That's why this pain is there all the time.</p>
<p>It isn't quite trusting of the world yet. And just like anyone who has been hurt, trust needs to be re-built over time. The only way to do so is by giving situations and signals of safety.</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving slowly.</li>
<li>Moving in ways that keep the part protected.</li>
<li>Reducing the range of motion</li>
<li>Paying attention</li>
<li>Ensuring you only move in ways where you can still breathe easily. (Ever notice how your breath stops just before you hit the pain?)</li>
<li>Removing the idea from your head of &quot;no pain no gain&quot;</li>
<li>Having someone dear to you whisper sweet things in your ear while you're moving like &quot;I love you&quot; ( Haha. Half-kidding about this one, but I am curious now that I've thought about it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using strategies like these addresses your brains desperate want for safety. As you start offering these signals, your system settles, your breath loosens, and you can feel more — which is crucial for the next part.</p>
<h3>You Need to Un-link the Movement = Pain Habit</h3>
<p><em>Chronic pain</em> is <em><strong>learned</strong> pain</em>. Your nervous system knows the exact point in your movement where the pain turns on.</p>
<p>Try this... sit there, imagine yourself doing a movement that you know gives you pain. Notice how your body responds as you sit there just imagining it.</p>
<p>You can tell the precise point where it feels &quot;unsafe&quot; right?</p>
<p>This is what we have to re-pattern.</p>
<p>We have to teach your nervous system that it's safe to move in this way again. In essence, you’re helping your system rediscover easier, more natural pathways — the ones it used to use before pain took over.</p>
<p>If you can re-engage with the learning process regarding your movement, you will be able to un-link the movement = pain habit. Instead, you'll be giving your nervous system signals that movement is easy and efficient and natural again.</p>
<h2>Pain Fades When These 2 Things Are Addressed</h2>
<p>When you use a strategy that accounts for the principles of pain, you can then begin working <em>with</em> yourself, rather than <em>against</em> yourself.</p>
<p>When you're safe, pain is no longer necessary.
When you're moving and your movement is efficient, enjoyable and easy - pain is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>It gradually fades away as you consistently address these principles.</p>
<p>Perhaps now you can also see why the strategies of strengthening and stretching aren't enough. When they're done well, there's opportunity for some improvement. But in many cases, they don't do anything for our body's sense of safety.</p>
<p>In many cases, they actually override the body's cries for safety. They often come from a subtle attitude of pushing through, as though saying.. &quot;oh just hurry up, stop whinging, lets get on with it&quot;.</p>
<p>My invitation, if that resonates with you at all, is to experiment with softening that approach a little. Treat the sore arm or sore hip the way you would with a toddler who is overwhelmed at the end of a hard day. Support. Gentleness. Love. Care.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>My hope is that you've understood something differently today about pain and it's role. I also hope that this understanding can help you move forward in a way that is more gentle and loving towards yourself.</p>
<p>I know pain is hard. It's difficult to resist the urge to just &quot;force it&quot; to get better. But my experience tells me that focusing more on safety and re-patterning is the best way to create lasting shifts.</p>
<p>Of course, if you feel overwhelmed by it all and you’d like company figuring out what this means for your own body, I’m here.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you have some other means of moving ahead, I hope that addressing these principles in it helps you get some relief faster than you anticipated.</p>
<p>Here’s to returning to a life that feels full again — one that’s shaped by the things you love. I’m cheering you on.</p>

      <title>Why Group Conversations Feel So Hard (And Why It’s Not Your Fault)</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-group-conversations-feel-so-hard/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-group-conversations-feel-so-hard/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>You know what it's like at a busy party or group gathering. Clusters of people engaged with each other, some laughing, some telling stories, possibly music playing...</p>
<p>Maybe you've felt anxious and awkward in spaces like this. You would love to be able to easily connect with someone and enjoy a conversation (like all the other people seem to be able to do). But something holds you back. You just can't seem to <em>make yourself</em> take the leap and just go and talk to someone.</p>
<p>Or if you do, whatever you say comes out sounding weird and you're pretty sure you've just infected this other person with your awkwardness now too.</p>
<p>I have spent a lot of my life like this. I was pretty sure that I was no good at peopleing. It just felt so difficult. Other people at these gatherings seemed to have a great time. They would just laugh and chat and connect with each other so naturally.</p>
<p>But me... NOPE.</p>
<p>Many years ago my uncle organised a ( <em>literally once-in-a-lifetime</em> ) gathering of all my extended relatives that I'd never met before. There was probably 70 people there all up.</p>
<p>I was curious about people, but somehow I couldn't find whatever I needed inside me in order to simply walk up to someone (who I was related to) and just say &quot;Hi&quot;.</p>
<p>I pretty much just stuck to the people I already knew and felt uncomfortable the whole day. Many years later, I wish I had spoken to some of them because it would be nice to understand my personal human context more.</p>
<p>Back then, I believed that <em>I was the problem</em>. I was too awkward. Too shy. Too weird. I didn't belong. They won't like me etc.</p>
<p>And just to plant a seed here — what I didn’t realise back then was that none of this difficulty was actually coming from a flaw inside me. That possibility never occurred to me.</p>
<p>With beliefs like that running through my head, I preferred to just go home instead of take advantage of the novel opportunity. It was all too draining.</p>
<p>Now that I've had the perspective of different training and experiences I feel so surprised at how mistaken I was back then. It's actually still shocking to me.</p>
<p>I thought I was bad at people.</p>
<p>But I didn't realise that the exact opposite is true.</p>
<p><em><strong>The truth is that I am highly attuned to the relational field.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you’re still here reading, I’m guessing that <em>something in your body recognises this possibility for yourself too.</em></p>
<p>I'd like to explore more about what that means in a moment, but for now I just wanted to say how much of a relief it was to let go of that story that there was something wrong about me.</p>
<p>If you believe you are shy and awkward and uncomfortable in groups because of some fault within you, let me take you aside for a moment. We need to have a chat.</p>
<p>Because the truth is, you want to connect with people right?</p>
<p>Deeply.</p>
<p>If you believe that deep connection is hard because of some innate fault, then you're basically stuck with an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>I would like to invite you into a different story. A story that is more accurate and actually grounded in the inner workings of your nervous system. A story that releases the pressure you might have been holding against yourself.</p>
<p>I think you'll come to see that actually you are the kind of person who is <strong>most likely</strong> to be able to have fantastic fulfilling connections and relationships with the right people.</p>
<p>Interested to see what I'm talking about? Lets chat.</p>
<h2>You Are Sensitive To Relational Information</h2>
<p>Your nervous system is attuned to information that serves a highly important function. It's <em>relational information</em>.</p>
<p>You're able to detect subtle cues that many other people miss. You pay attention and notice things that others don't. When you walk into a room and there's been a fight, you know it instantly. Your awareness is attuned in this way.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel it in the tightness in your belly, or the slight freeze behind your eyes, or that subtle urge to withdraw before you’ve even had a conscious thought.</p>
<p>You may not always have the correct <em>interpretation</em> immediately. But you feel it inside your body somewhere.</p>
<p>People who identify as sensitive or introverted can make the mistake of turning this sense into a story about yourself. This is a terrible tragedy!</p>
<p>You have been brought up in a world that doesn't know or celebrate the gifts of introversion. So with the absence of fitting into what society does celebrate and love, you have drawn the conclusion that there is something wrong with YOU instead!</p>
<p>The truth though, is that you're just a highly attuned sensor. You likely haven't even realised the full potential of your gifts yet.</p>
<p>When I started doing <em>coaching work</em> and <em>mens work</em> is when I first started understanding that what I was feeling all along was actually useful information. The uncomfortable sensations in my body weren't problems with me, they were relational information which could be used to deepen connection, heal pains and build bridges towards other people.</p>
<h2>Groups are often incoherent</h2>
<p>Many groups in modern society are missing relational harmony. There may have a shared purpose like...</p>
<ul>
<li>celebrating (party)</li>
<li>building something (workplace)</li>
<li>learning something (training)</li>
</ul>
<p>...but that doesn't guarantee that everything is &quot;heading in the same direction&quot;</p>
<p>The way I really came to understand this was by being in groups where there <em>was</em> coherence. Places where <em>nothing was left unsaid</em>. There were no unaddressed elephants in the room. The integrity of the relational container was of utmost priority.</p>
<p>In spaces like this, I experienced for the first time a letting go, a freedom in myself. I felt connected and loved and in harmony with other people.</p>
<p>I was in BIG groups too. Sometimes up to 50-100 people. In these spaces, where the relational field was prioritized, I was able to be my authentic self without my self-defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>It was only once I felt THIS in my body that I realised the extent of how chaotic most groups are by comparison.</p>
<p>In many groups you'll have a mix of unspoken relational information flying around...</p>
<ul>
<li>Differing intentions - sometimes opposing each other.</li>
<li>Pain and suffering which is being projected at other people.</li>
<li>Victim - perpetrator - rescuer dynamics playing out.</li>
<li>Varying levels of trauma responses</li>
<li>Hyperstimulated people (think caffeine, social media, addictions)</li>
<li>Unprocessed feelings</li>
<li>Varying levels of medications / drug use / abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't want to sound like I'm making any of this wrong. This is the beautiful wild mess of human existence. Here we are! But what I do want to point out, is that THIS is the information that you're dealing with.</p>
<p>And crucially — you’re not consciously analysing all of this. Your body is tracking it automatically. That’s why it can feel overwhelming. Not because you’re socially inept, but because you’re registering <em>real signals</em> that most people simply don’t pick up.</p>
<p>You walk into a room with 100 people and you're sensing alllllllll of that stuff allllll at once. And then you feel funny in your tummy and you think that it's because you're bad at people!!!!</p>
<p>No No No my sweet beautiful sensitive powerful human. You are NOT the problem here.</p>
<h2>The stories you tell to keep yourself safe</h2>
<p>My biggest story has been that &quot;I'm Shy&quot;. I've told it to myself all my life.</p>
<p>These stories serve an incredibly important function. They keep us safe.</p>
<p>If I am shy, then I don't have to engage. I can stay playing shy.</p>
<p>This strategy has served me so well throughout my life.</p>
<p>I didn't realise any of what I just shared when I was younger. I didn't realise that other people can cause me a lot of pain. But thank god my nervous system knew. It just told me that I'm shy so that I could justify hiding away. That saved me a lot of pain that I wasn't really capable of dealing with at the time.</p>
<p>Now that I have evolved and found safety within myself, I no longer need the story that I'm shy. I can let it go and allow the deeper truth to emerge. This is where superpowers begin to come online. This is where people start to reflect back to you that you're a great listener, or that you're so intuitive, or that you know how to navigate the internal worlds so well.</p>
<p>And it shows up in real moments — like when you somehow know a friend is hurting before they say a word, or when you can feel the emotional tone of a conversation shift even while the words stay polite. These “strange abilities” you’ve chalked up to being weird? They’re actually forms of relational intelligence.</p>
<h2>My invitation to you</h2>
<p>Start to pay attention to what is ACTUALLY happening in your body in group situations.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to notice the ways you interpret that information. Then, allow yourself to see the truth of how sensitive and attuned you are to relational dynamics.</p>
<p>If you want a tiny, doable practice: next time you enter a group, don’t try to be confident or “on.” Just notice one sensation. One signal from your body. That’s it. Let that be enough.</p>
<p>How would it feel to operate in the world knowing that it's actually your superpower to connect with people?</p>
<p>With this in mind, you're free to choose what spaces you want to inhabit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you like big raging parties? Or would you prefer a quiet hobby where you can dive deep with people?</li>
<li>Do you like &quot;networking events&quot;? Or would you prefer to invite people into spaces that YOU create?</li>
<li>Do you want to learn at a university? Or would a smaller container that goes deeper serve you better?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know for myself I value depth, honesty, integrity, authenticity, sensitivity and care. The people I surround myself with either have or support these qualities. If they don't, we're just not a match.</p>
<p>I'm not for everyone.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>But the people I AM a match with. Boy does it feel good. We go deep. There's no inhibitions. There's truth telling. There's deep empathy and understanding. Seeing and being seen.</p>
<p>This is the world I inhabit.</p>
<p>And the beautiful part is — you get to build the world you inhabit too. A world designed for your nervous system, not against it.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What world would you like to inhabit?</p>
<h2>Coming full circle</h2>
<p>Now that I have replaced my old story (which frankly hurt every time I told it to myself) with a new one, I am much more free now to be who I am. I don't have to contort myself.</p>
<p>I have deeper self understanding about the mechanics that are operating inside my system.</p>
<p>I just realise I'm wired differently to other people.</p>
<p>But there's also a lot of people who are wired like me too.</p>
<p>And we tend to get on with each other really well.</p>
<p>Now I can just show up authentically without feeling drained by social situations. I just sometimes don't enjoy them, so I don't participate. Easy.</p>
<p>My hope is that if you have some of these stories going on, then you're also able to see the deeper truth about yourself.</p>
<p>I hope this framing provides you some relief, opens the doorways to new connections that are actually nourishing for your nervous system, and also begins to awaken your latent superpowers.</p>
<p>So much love and support to you my friend. Hope to see you out there.</p>

      <title>Why Some People Feel Effortless to Be With (And Others Drain You)</title>
      <link href="https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-some-people-feel-effortless-to-be-with/"/>
      <updated>2025-11-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://www.tomwilson.nz/posts/why-some-people-feel-effortless-to-be-with/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <p>Have you noticed how being around some people is incredibly draining. While with others it is really uplifting?</p>
<p>With some people you feel hollow inside and when you leave their presence you need to go through a process in order to feel yourself again.</p>
<p>With other people there's a kind of resonance you can't fake. You can say anything to them and they get it, they understand you at a level that's so much deeper. It's almost as though they know you better than you know yourself.</p>
<p>When you leave this type of persons presence, you feel recharged, energized and enthused about life. You want to spend more time with them and it feels nourishing.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered about WHY this happens? And perhaps even more importantly, how do you create a life filled with people who charge your battery?</p>
<p>Maybe you've got some ideas about why that might be. Most people do.</p>
<p>You might consider it through the lens of compatibility. You have your personality, they have their's. They either match or they don't. End of story.</p>
<p>Or maybe you turn it inward:
&quot;it doesn't feel good with this person, that's because, I'm too X (introverted? shy? weird? socially awkward? sensitive?)&quot;</p>
<p>Or you assume it’s a confidence issue — that if you were just more relaxed or charismatic, the interaction would magically feel different.</p>
<p>What I have noticed though is that there's something deeper happening under these explanations.</p>
<p>The real difference isn’t who you are.<br>
It’s what your nervous systems are doing together.</p>
<p>Some people pull you out of yourself without meaning to.<br>
Others help you settle, soften, and come home.</p>
<p>So when you catch yourself thinking it’s your “shyness” or “introversion” acting up again, pause for a moment. It might be something else entirely: your body responding accurately to the signals in the space between you.</p>
<p>Those sensations aren’t flaws.<br>
They’re information.</p>
<h2>The Dance of Two Nervous Systems</h2>
<p>Nervous systems are always on the lookout for safety - this includes physical, emotional, psychological etc. This is an unconscious process which is happening in the background.</p>
<p>When we perceive safety, we open, relax and drop into a state of nervous system activity which promotes social connection. This is the space where resonance and that feeling that someone deeply <em>gets you</em> comes from.</p>
<p>In this state our entire system is tuned for social connection. We hear audio frequencies better in the range of human voices. Our voices become more melodic. Our faces become more expressive and we also read other peoples faces with more accuracy. Our body language becomes more open, relaxed, at ease.</p>
<p>In this state, we are not only receiving signals of safety from other people. We're also giving those signals. There is a dance where two people can help each other to feel more open, relaxed and connected.</p>
<p>When our unconscious scanning perceives signals of danger, it triggers nervous system states which promote protection. Our deepest in-built survival strategies come online. We are more prepared for fighting, running, or freezing.</p>
<p>These strategies are draining. You have more tunnel vision. A more monotonous voice. A harder expression on your face. You might feel hyperactivated - like you need to get away. Or you might feel lethargic, as though you want to find a corner to hide in. Your muscles will hold more tension and rigidity. Or less than normal tension.</p>
<p>This is the experience which you'll feel you need to shake off, just to feel like yourself again.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though, your nervous system scans for <em>many</em> different things.</p>
<p>For sure there's factors about the other person, their emotional state, the way they move, their language, their protective mechanisms, their mannerisms, their appearance, how they sound etc.</p>
<p>There's also environmental factors - how safe is your location? Are there other people around that you trust? Could you escape if necessary?</p>
<p>Your brain decides based on these things and many others, which mode to activate in you and how much of that mode. More protection? More openness?</p>
<p>This is why your connection with the other person is context dependent and changeable. Their nervous system is running the same way yours is. It's checking if you're safe and creating changes in real-time.</p>
<p>It's a dance.</p>
<p>This dance is visible in brain scans when 2 people are synced with each other. The same parts of their brains activate. There's harmony between them.</p>
<h2>The Feelings are Information</h2>
<p>So if you're with someone and you're feeling self-protective, it's actually a product of the dance of your nervous systems. It's not about how shy you are, or socially awkward, or un-confident. It's doesn't need to mean that you're simply 2 incompatible people.</p>
<p>Rather, it's information. It just means that you're not feeling 100% safe on all levels with this person yet.</p>
<p>Now you have options. You might say well this person is just some random person. I don't feel that good around them right now. I am free to leave. There's something about the way our nervous systems are dancing together at this current moment that makes me brace.</p>
<p>You could always take a break come back later if you're interested and it might have changed. You might need a different context - ie: <a href="/posts/why-group-conversations-feel-so-hard/">not at a party</a></p>
<p>For example, my partner loves spending time with her mother, but if they ever go out shopping anywhere together, my partner feels incredibly drained by it. Shopping with other people? Fine. Doing other things with her mother? Fine. It's that particular combination that doesn't work well.</p>
<p>But equally, you might just choose to move on and find another person who you like dancing with reliably.</p>
<p>However, if this person is important to you, know that it's completely possible to improve the dance between you. Some things that could help...</p>
<ul>
<li>Using curiosity to guide a conversation which explores how you feel with the other person.</li>
<li>Taking some emotional risks, putting down the defenses that you might be using.</li>
<li>Sharing your intentions with this person, letting them know what they mean to you.</li>
<li>Asking for what you would like in order to feel more open around them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how each of these things supports emotional safety? They are risks that require deeper trust. And when you're willing to go there, you invite the other person to go there too.</p>
<h2>Something to Try</h2>
<p>Next time you're with someone, I invite you to notice your body sensations and to interpret them simply as information. If you consciously pay attention to how safe you're feeling (whether that's physically, emotionally, or otherwise), what do you notice? What types of things make you feel safe and grounded and open, what types of things make you brace and contract?</p>
<p>Beginning to bring your awareness to these is a way that you can actually start to navigate the complex world of relationships with more skill. As you learn about yourself and the way your nervous system interacts with others, you can discover the real things that recharge you.</p>
<p>For example, I notice that I feel comfortable around people who don't need to fill every space with words. When someone is comfortable in silence, some part of my nervous system feels more at ease and trusting.</p>
<p>I also notice that people who can talk about how they feel without running away or changing topic, also helps me feel safe.</p>
<p>This is just information. It's not a deal-breaker if someone doesn't feel safe enough to share their feelings with me immediately.</p>
<p>The empowering part of this all is that I have influence on the interaction too.</p>
<p>I can actually model what it's like to share how I feel without hiding... This often gives other people permission to do the same and it can help to create a dance of openness between you both.</p>
<h2>If You've Thought of Yourself as Introverted</h2>
<p>If you've held the identity of someone who is &quot;introverted&quot; like I have, you may notice that this idea of nervous systems dancing starts to bring some flexibility to that identity.</p>
<p>Suddenly it's not so fixed in stone anymore. Maybe you - just like other people - have been searching for safety in your connections. Yet your strategy for finding that safety looks different to other strategies. Maybe yours has been about retracting and spending time alone. You may feel safety from different contexts and qualities than other people do.</p>
<p>But strategies are flexible. Humans are equipped for adaptation and learning.</p>
<p>If you are looking for deep and fulfilling social connections - yet you've been convinced that your makeup has prevented it from happening - I believe that honouring the constant feedback from your nervous system is what will guide you towards a life brimming with deeply fulfilling connections.</p>
<p>I encourage you to listen within, your guidance system is well and truly working</p>
